if you drop it for any reason ,  its likely broken . 
if you want an alternative to this oil ,  orofluido is much better ,  smells better and has more lasting results . 
but its probably more to do with the storage than removing the adults !  . 
after seeing similar hoses on tv ,  i was excited to try this out . 
these did nothing special for my cats that an ordinary bed or blanket couldn t provide . 
swimming is no better because enemies can always see you and you can only hide underwater while being still . 
she s unlikely to ever scratch that part ,  especially considering how big and loud  the ball part of  it is . 
this must be done carefully or else you will dislodge the charms . 
i will never buy anything from this brand again . 
at least you can take a shower afterwards . 
and there was a huge gap that would never close and exposed a part of the phone . 
she can t walk with it becuase it either falls apart or it trips her . 
the scent is still kind of strange ,  and on your face scent definitely matters . 
indicating that a good portion of the gymnema has been cut in favor of the flour . 
normally i love love love this product but it tasted odd and i ended up throwing it all away . 
i d send it back if i could do so without paying postage . 
it is all in the marketing ,  do not fall for the hype . 
it s just burn and traumatizes your skin ,  nothing else . 
word to the wise ,  try natural remedies prior to chemical solutions ,  just might be the answer for you . 
if you want to use the shuffle or program features you have to use the menu on you tv . 
the smallest is an aggressive chewer ,  and i thought that this would be a great toy for him . 
i have to say that i am not a fan of this item . 
ergon grips move your weight to the base of your hand . 
i installed this on a mossberg num_num and stripped the threads . 
i wanted them for playing tennis but did not even get that far . 
mind you ,  i received excellent customer service from the seller ,  but the product just didn t work . 
i cannot express how embarrassing such a situation is . 
they are people who just bought the product and haven t had much experience with it . 
it also has an optical out ,  which it should . 
you mix it with num_num ounces of water and you get this bland medicine like drink out of it . 
anyways i ve been using syntha for the past two years and regret trying to go back to on . 
then it dies and you gain about num_extend xp points . 
i tried dying both my lashes and brows ,  and both were a disaster . 
i found it to time consuming to try it very often and bought the real sausage making equipment . 
it is the deep purple color of a dark purple eggplant . 
they are very thin leather with a cheap sole and probably cost about ten dollars maximum to produce . 
i knew coming in that this game wasn t going to be the madden of old . 
it can take under four hours to beat it . 
i have always dreamed of a solid bluetooth headset for my phone . 
it also uses extra num_extend from the gun to move num_num paintballs around and down to the barrel . 
then i was trying to grap the top holder . 
not sure if this was from the acid in it or something else ,  maybe the cinnamon . 
the most recently bag contained mostly smaller bully sticks that reeked terribly . 
i also thought the lace trim was itchy . 
this kettle looks pretty but doesn t turn off once it boils . 
i got ripped off and it s not worth the money or effort . 
i bought another lot thinking it was a lot problem but it was the same . 
then it finishes with a stevia after taste !  yuck . 
i personally think its because these are fanless ,  and seem to overheat very quickly . 
i bought this because of the high reviews . 
it leaks when it s level ,  and faster when it s tipped swaying in the wind . 
 :  update :  i did find the directions for installation in the envelope . 
i cooked chicken and steak on it the first night and it worked okay . 
i received this product a couple days ago . 
i far exceed the suggested system ,  yet my game stuttered in the strangest ,  seemingly least demanding places . 
unhappy with it ,  actually i already replaced them . 
 don t try this in a top loader ,  it will probably destroy the mat  . 
then ,  he told me that my order was being held up because there was a hurricane in the pacific . 
it was claimed that this was compatible with my panasonic cordless landline system . 
maybe you need some silocone in your hair sometimes just to be able to get a brush through it . 
it has wheat derived ingredients ,  which causes skin irritation for a lot of people . 
if the toy actually worked consistently ,  it would be great . 
i took this and could tell no difference ,  except it turns your poo the color of the box . 
i stretched the rubber band and it worked !  for num_num minutes . 
i have owned the game for quite a long time and still haven t beaten the first level by myself . 
it was very difficult to get started and keep going . 
i am a true size num_num and that s what i bought . 
i have one or two other  one star  items but many four and five star items . 
i really wanted to give this system a fair shot . 
their dmso is produced through a chemical reaction . 
however ,  it is asking to much to have only num_num installs . 
my coworker described it as;  autumn leaf red  whatever that means ,  ha . 
if you screw up you can t restart the race !  which leads me to my next num_extend backtracking . 
i have brows that are fairly thin but mostly they stop short of the average length brow . 
i ve had this unit for a few years . 
this crap is for the masses that don t know any better . 
with that said ,  the flow on this hose isn t that great and the connectors suck . 
one everything is opened ,  it is difficult to get it back inside again so i left the cup out . 
there is also a high probability that mold could form there during storage . 
crawford describes in his excellent review of this product . 
i found that one must go painfully slow to try and prevent that from happening . 
you d actually have to start a brand new game to do so . 
it started to have clicking sounds and searches would take num_num minutes; this was after num_num months of use . 
it is a novel jewelry box or trinket holder . 
i swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity . 
when you mix with your conditioner ,  you have to pour it . 
i am not computer illeterate ,  but you have to have a systems degree to install this unit . 
i have a normal width foot with a bit of a high instep ,  but this just didn t work . 
if you want spicy just go for chai . 
i think this will be really cool when some of the bugs are worked out . 
so my question is what do you want to do with it and why . 
no instructions are included ,  although it s possible to google some good sites . 
they are only num_num calories because they are unbelievably small not because they are nutritional . 
well i will blame it on this thing ,  the screws striped my rifle . 
i also tightened the tension on the perch in case birds found the springiness disconcerting . 
another parent stated that the toy is small . 
i bought the charger in june and it was broken by august . 
not my cup of tea !  but if you like spicy teas then this is for you . 
the rose flavor is the one highlight but there was not much of that in the package . 
now whenever i leave the house ,  my dogs have to be locked up . 
despite the description and the packaging ,  these gloves are not cotton flock lined . 
there is nothing special that designates that this is worth num_num dollars . 
i wish i had paid better attention before purchasing . 
so no stars deducted for that . however ,  i like a body wash that lathers up well . 
to add insult to injury ,  the interface is pretty awful ,  too . 
after many hours ,  i just put the battery into the phone and it was fully charged . 
i had this on subscribe and save for a while . 
i have heard this was a good brand ,  and the video looked great . 
most aren t related to how the top is screwed on or the filter basket is latched . 
one of the internal ports is bent so i cannot plug a usb into it . 
i was disappointed since i normally like the little people toys . 
barely past the knees ,  it was extremely tight . 
i don t know why they ship the returned product as new one . 
i gave them each the recommended amount ,  waited ,  and nothing . 
we ordered several different colors and patterns ,  all by rothco . 
i am disappointed i bought the game without previewing it first . 
when i first got this item ,  it was great and had alot of fun with it . 
they do work ,  and my cats learned to stay away from the cans very quickly . 
i m sure there a method to this madness ,  but it s on , y me that cares . 
i tried it for a week ,  and now know for sure . 
sometimes this is hard when the surrounding danger gets intense ,  but most of the time it s painfully easy . 
the final death blow to the sound quality comes from the voice acting . 
i made two identical cheescakes at the same time . 
this seems to be well built ,  but i need a shoe horn to get my nexus num_num to fit . 
you d be better off with the older style that doesn t use batteries . 
people complain that the xbox version could ve been more realistic . 
i saw these recommended and hoped they d improve my digestion . 
the product was a waste of my money . 
you see ,  there are many filters in this machine . 
it was only supporting num_extend but otherwise setup was so easy . 
i realized that it s just like the original ,  just bigger . 
do this for num_num minutes and it can lower your blood pressure maybe num_num points  on top  . 
just like all the other denman brushes ,  the back of the brushes slide out . 
first ,  there are similar games with better grahpics ,  like myst . 
cheap ,  just parely covered the phone and it is hard to get onand off . 
if you put much pressure on your head while using it ,  it hurts . 
i think the little bit of pressure on the button is what caused my phone to act up . 
i m dead serious ,  the only way to attack is with missle launches . 
the ac adapter is num_extend at num_extend amps which seems to provide more than enough voltage . 
i did not notice any effect from this supplement . 
the textured  nubs  on the back of the watch are awful . 
i have acne prone skin and i was hoping that it would help clear up breakouts . 
i love adventure games and own all the originals from sierra and lucasarts . 
i didn t have a good experience with this product . 
the tines are flimsy and there are not have enough tines to be effective . 
the focus button is the only cool part of the game . 
they have the lowest price anywhere for this game . 
on one of my previous cars ,  i tried valeo num_num ultimate blades  similar to anco contour  . 
a box of num_num is like a one year supply for me . 
i use it all the time in my recliner . 
water tastes great through a brita filter ,  but this pitcher is poorly designed . 
only to discover to my horror that the cheap p . o . s . 
i bought this product to help even out some redness and solve mild acne . 
get the ground hogs ,  you ll get what you pay for : msr ground hog stake kit . 
i know a lot of people who have merrell s so i hope my new pair is a good fit . 
you need a flat area about two inches square ,  where you want to mount it . 
people say later you download more ,  but thats just a rumor . 
it s quick and fun and doesn t require too much thought . 
yet ,  weirdly ,  the spandex around my ankles is way too tight . 
she stated that i most likely had a refurbished unit ,  which immediately made sense . 
the main issue is that the pad is located in the wrong place . 
this thing made  notice the past tense  great popcorn . 
the set is missing a firm ,  flat brush for packing shadow onto the lid . 
the sequels never took my interest either . not the best fighting game by far . graphics csound cgameplay clasting appeal c+ . 
it looks great ,  but don t try to move it . 
you have to build your town ,  make soldiers ,  etc . 
on my scale ,  it weighs over num_num ounces with batteries . 
this is so convenient when you want charge your extra battery . 
she played with it for about num_num hours total the first few days she received it . 
she spoke pretty good english but she was on drugs or something . 
they re packed in there so well you need to scrape them num_extend
but this spanx camisole was definitely not for me . 
but first and foremost ,  a gadget must work . 
i m pretty sensitive to heavily scented things and it just made my stomach turn while trying to sleep . 
i also don t care for the brown color . 
and all comes in a can the size of a red bull for num_num calories . i did not like it . 
i don t want my children thinking an f is a g and q is an e . 
salicylic acid seems to be better for me for now . 
we took it apart and substituted nickles which work very well and won t break . 
after only a few months of use it is leaking from the hendle . 
i had to throw out the remaining packets after trying several . 
thank god for ritz crackers as i was then able to consume . 
the quality of desktop speakers has risen to a very high level in the last couple of years . 
we received this knife for our wedding  august num_extend
i am ok with gun recoil ,  and moving slow when wearing a bunch of armor . 
is indoors ,  so weather conditions do not num_extend
i threw away the lilac vegetal the next day . 
after giving it a week ,  i am tossing it out . 
i didn t see anything special about this one that deserves a higher price . 
i now have about num_num red bumps on my forehead that i cant get rid of . 
i have bought a lot of mascara in my day ,  and this is just like any other . 
thankfully it s under num_num days so i m returning it . 
this didn t stay in place at all for me no matter what shoes i had on . 
i also found the hover bikes to be nearly impossible to control . 
i got it set up ,  and then tried to dry some dishes in it . 
as soon as i stopped using it ,  my face stopped breaking out . 
my old compact dryer blows more air and as a result ,  is easier to use and style with . 
i ve been buying bali products for num_num years and this is my first complaint . 
i have a strict skincare regimen and when i heard all of the reviews and how its so great . 
apple needs to understand that their ipods  designs are flawed . 
units have horrible pathing and no sort of structure . 
so basically your buying a cheap coffee maker with a good carafe . 
i was not really impressed with this sprayer . 
so save your dough ,  buy any color but red . diva s !  !  !  !  what can i say ?  . 
my characters started moving by themselves .  .  . planes started flying themselves . 
it turns out this battery only has a capacity of num_extend and i am feeling very ripped off . 
received one of these as a gift ,  but wouldn t let the puppy eat it after checking the ingredients . 
the taste was bitter and sharp ,  not smooth and had a yucky  fake  taste . 
on the whole the gameplay tries to deliver an adequate amount of mayhem . 
the side with the coconut oil had better texture ,  tightening and my skin looked a lot more readiant . 
i wish i had of researched more before my purchase of this . 
is there a cartoon with these characters ?  i wasn t familiar with these little critters before getting this set . 
its sensitivity reminds me of asa num_num speed film . 
saeco was very responsive back then and picked up the machine and repaired it promptly . 
it s bulky and heavy to move ,  yet made out of flimsy plastic . 
so i know his size these were either missed marked or num_extend or something . 
maybe designed to fit num_extend not num_extend do not line up either . 
but that s a bit expensive ,  so just look around . 
it s so small i didn t even see it for what it was . 
we rated this lower because of what we like in a game . 
these ,  however ,  were not the typical high quality i m used to with this company . they felt thinner and very cheap !  . 
she rarely played with it after the novelty wore off . 
in my trip ,  my daughter and i eventually took turns to carry the bag . 
i do not want the hassle of returning item but the quality of the wheels are cheap ,  cheap ,  cheap . 
i returned these cause the fit and the look of them didn t suit me . 
description needs to state the size of the adapter . 
num_num day things were good then my peas disappeared . 
these are cheap head phones and the style isn t too bad since they are flat to the ears . 
i bought these on impulse as they were on sale . 
do not get magnetic ones you ll just wasted your money . 
your objective now is to find a way back home  how creative  . 
my old ms optical mouse never had any problems . 
i purchased thinking this would be a fun indoor activity . 
comparing the two they don t look the same as the one listed in the picture either . 
bought this for my daughter and i have seen balloons bigger than this thing . 
this stuff is not cheap and this brand doesn t work as a sweetener ,  in my opinion . 
i don t know how that slot will affect the temperature holding ability of the thermal pot . 
she will get frustrated with the hair and give up . 
they are not the tasty treat of the past and these were made in different country . 
as an alternative ,  i recommend taking a multivitamin with a glass of water . 
this clear one had the power button break within days . 
and even then ,  i would replay the former titles again before sending buying this one . 
i tasted a small amount before feeding it to my daughter and determined that it was ,  indeed ,  bad . 
so ,  then i went to target and very carefully looked at the brushes and determined that they were genuine . 
must be something cheap from china ,  so i tossed it . 
yes they are attractive ,  i love the simple lines and the curve at the bottom . 
i followed the instructions and hung it in an area well populated with yellow jackets . 
i had a frame fit silca as well as a zefal in the past . 
out of all of the stray hairs on my brows ,  only three were removed with these strips . 
the programmers make sure that you have hardly any life before you reach the end . 
the product has nothing on the label to help you know what is in it . 
 hey it s been a while since i used this . 
you better point the device right at the ir port on your camera . 
after one day the adjustment dial began to come away from wristband . 
nowhere on the page did i see that this is a vegetarian product . 
this is especially evident during cutscenes when you are required to operate the controls . 
if it were good ,  my kids would probably drink num_num at a sitting . 
it is a very nice and cute pan but i will not start out with damaged goods . 
i just purchased this one ,  and after num_extend use ,  cut my finger . 
these are made in china and you can draw your own conclusions . 
mounted on my benjamin np ,  would not hold position . 
i opened the box ,  set up the pool  very easy and began filling . 
it s fast ,  convenient ,  and a healthy start to the day . 
my wife was unable to operate it . we cleaned it up and she returned it today . 
the kids are not basically making up what they do as they go along . 
she does seem to like the merrick bg dry food . 
we got it out of the box and it looked fine . 
that s what makes this game so damn frustrating and boring . 
i ve tried adjusting the volume to see if that would help ,  no such luck . 
great cleaner ,  but num_num stars for the bottle design . 
stick to creapure monohydrate if you want a good source of creatine . 
do not buy !  do not use !  unnatural color . 
this is a genuinely useless product ,  at least as far as squirrels are concerned . 
my num_extend did not work ,  as the other person could not hear me ,  although i could hear them . 
organcs smaller sized than regular but i find that to be true on most organics ,  which is quite acceptable . 
i thought it was me ,  and i didnt remember what it was supposed to be like . 
at it best it puffs and goes out like the candle on a birthday cake . 
please ignore those reviewers who played a game or two and said this game was great . 
i really never understood the craze of this game . 
i recently bought this card to add on to my hp desktop computer . 
my computer crashed recently and took the hard drive with it . 
fortunately ,  i opened the bag and poured it out in a bowl before eating any . 
clean design with an easy to read dial . 
i wish they carried reliable products ,  but they ,  like i thought it was a superior brand . 
i finished the num_num oz glass ,  but soon after began to feel nauseous . 
i bought this based on all the reviews i read here . 
what a piece of junk !  !  !  !  i had high hopes for this iron after reading all the good reviews . 
incredibly worthless and complex drm that ruins thepoint of owning the num_extend
the adhesive doesn t work at all ,  and so you ll need to glue them on . 
has better heat transference ,  cheaper ,  and looks and feels more durable . 
did not stay together well and was advertised that it folds and did not fold ,  sent back . 
linksys num_num port switch num_extend ver num_extend arrived fast in new shrink wrapped box from beach camera through amazon . 
i only successful used it to remove two hairs  took num_num minutes  ,  which eventually grew back the next month . 
i gave it one star because we don t have a zero star option . 
the cover is supposed to slide down inside the measure cup . 
my friend swears by this nail polish and says it makes her nails hard and therefore able to grow . 
i think i could have gotten the same results with aluminum foil . 
i thought this looked really cool in pictures . 
at least i can go to my local walmart and buy it !  . 
but i seem to be a little bit sensitive to num_extend and apparently i m not the only one . 
you have to cut the cord in half . 
these are bright bags with wacky prints on them . 
all i remember is that it was thick and highly nappy . 
they re also made in china now ,  which i don t like . 
it doesn t state artificial flavorings in the ingredients list on amazon .  .  .  .  . but they are listed on the box . 
i got a large eye screw ,  installed it in wall opposite toilet with large sail boat rope . 
becareful ,  it seemed to calm me down just a tiny bit . 
the aftertaste is just way too herbal ,  grassy tasting for me . 
so most of the calories is coming from sugar and fat . 
they are using limited activations to prevent second hand sales and to limit the lifetime of the game . 
i went to a jewelry store ,  got a cloth and got the blue off as well as the tarnish . 
but the illumination does not turn on at the desired time . 
only after i downloaded the detailed instructions from their website was i able to get it to work properly . 
cat is not a huge fan and i really got sick of stepping on them because it hurt . 
i m far from stupid but some of the puzzles just aren t at all obvious . 
my original cuisinart is num_num years old and still working well . 
i am not impressed . i didn t notice any change in symptoms or discomforts related to prostate issues . 
instead of a lovely golden yellow ,  it is the light brown of a beef or vegetable broth . 
first ,  the sticker on the original cable is perfectly sized and fits in the little mold that it has . 
battle : like its predecessors ,  this star ocean has a relatively active battle system among the pantheon of rpgs . 
i thought at first it was reading celcius but that didn t work either . 
i had fun with it ,  although it does not merit it s price tag as is . 
legitimate game companies don t need to resort to cheap tricks like that . 
this compression support elastic knee does not provide any knee support . 
if you get this keep it away from the hot pan if you are not currently flipping a pancake . 
i thought my dog would love this assortment ,  but he basically is turning his nose up at it . 
it is very hard to get a regular potato through as well . 
seller did an excellent job and sent the headset right away . 
no more knives or forks stuck in to do this !  i love that it will defrost frozen bread . 
you can t change from num_extend to num_extend person . 
i really wanted this stuff to be as good as the infomercials say it is . 
i ve used marble runs from other manufacturers and have not experienced this level of poor design . 
if we d used the standard strips with the two lines we d have an answer . avoid computerized tests like this . 
this put a pretty good blade on my kitchen knife set  calphalon  the first few times i used it . 
i returned this !  i could not adjust it all . 
it s all peach ,  i don t taste any tea . 
the cost to make one is probably num_num cents . 
yet my hand seems too small to fit over the ball and push the buttons . 
they never really liked this thing even though it gives my two big fat rats more room . 
right there on the front ,  in the king s english and everything . 
but for me ,  i have to have a pleasant taste and this drink does not have it . 
i did not get that ,  but the sticker on the tine says it was with handle . 
i found the camera to be quite good ,  though i never used any video features . 
i would say please don t buy this product . 
this unit worked great for about a week . 
no power at all no matter what angle . 
the flour being enriched would not provide the nutritional value of whole wheat . 
this foundation did not even out my skin tone whatsoever . 
if you want to get rid of hair ,  try waxing . 
it happened so many times that accidental pressing of multifunction button redials last number . 
it is probably a perfect item for someone who likes quick ,  weak coffee one cup at a time . 
bought this to replaced a scoop made in num_extend
but the pain relief ,  for me at least ,  has been minimal . 
i love first person shooters ,  i ve played tons of them making me wonder why this game is so praised . 
if you use enough to get your solution to jell ,  the texture is poor and rubbery . 
i would get the bigger version of this product and not waste your time on these little darts . 
after a week ,  i called for a status . 
so far i have found mac concealer to be the best in terms of coverage and looking natural . 
long spiral waves are pretty on a teenage girl . 
or just over  .  . not going up to about just below my knees . 
the dogs were playing tug of war with it their favorite game  and it started bending and breaking apart . 
the case is big and has lots of room; everything else is bad news . 
this means that when cooking steam will condense there and oils from food will also collect there . 
the changing lights are definitely adding to the novelty . 
i liked it at first ,  but the bearings failed after one year of light use . 
it has a nice wood smell ,  is super absorbent ,  and is easy to clean up . 
this game is stupid ! don t evem think about buying this item !  . 
so thats my only complaint for a $ case . 
i bought this pan because it was rated pretty good ,  but trust me this pan is garbage . 
customer service from this company is also very poor . 
had to continuously reboot router due to lost signals; customer support useless . 
it is cheaper to buy another cable than it would be to ship the defective one back . 
this is a great skillet ,  especially for the price . 
i used it for a while although it unfortunately necessitates removing my num_extend from its speck case . 
finer tastes however will reject this stuff ,  i think because it has little cheese . 
and it was very unlikely to shatter if dropped . 
way to much !  the hearts are ugly and i was just unhappy . 
they went on fine ,  but i wouldn t buy them again . 
this thing must be on the slow boat from china . 
not happy and therefore i cannot recommend this bra . 
there s a lot of work to be done . 
i have a very hard time understanding where the ball is supposed to go . 
it was very flimsy as well ,  and didn t work . 
it also  basically from day num_extend always seemed to smell like burning rubber . 
would not recommend this product if you expect it to fly . 
the armored core series has had a rusty life the last few years . 
i didn t know about the warning until the next day . 
this is a rather pathetic rainbow that doesn t work very well . 
i cant hit the target in num_num yard after intalled this item . 
i m glad this works for some people ,  but it was worthless to me . 
the pills just make it a little easier to stick to the diet !  . 
i called kodak and was advised to download their new software . 
this trash tastes like cardboard packaging ,  and sugar and vitamin c added ?  i am sorry ,  that is not %
was taking product and i had to stop ,  as my stomach was very upset after using it . 
this product is made of very stiff material and has a very small opening to fill and empty it . 
i cleaned it as directed ,  waited for the green light and poured in the batter . 
since moving to the country ,  we ve had a problem with clothes moths . 
even when i push the ball ,  can t get much speed . 
this is one of marvel s more pathetic attempts at a video game . 
i would not recommend these for who would find those issues to be deal breakers . 
i may have to cut them off my rims . 
i pushed the pin back in and the clip is working . 
although they liked it ,  it did not fitmy standards or liking . 
so don t think the mouse patch makes this game playable . also ,  the graphics in the pc version are unbelievably bad . 
i know many people swear by this product ,  but i think it is a crappy product . 
this tire has  kevlar  in it ?  yeah ,  right . 
i m not even remotely impressed with the chatter phone . 
the sound quality is pretty good ,  but these headphones are not loud . 
i took this on chance that it d help with some bruises i suffered from workout injuries . 
i m a fan of the rts genre in general . 
i thought these would be great give her a little traction and keep her from licking . 
i d love to protect my screens but this isn t the way to do it . 
but these are pretty bad ,  have purplish tent on the lenses . 
and maybe they ll get there if they haven t already . 
buyer needs to beware of the expiration date on the product . 
i normally purchase the smaller can of evo ,  but the % my cats would not touch . 
save your time and money ,  order them from somebody else . 
uses the remote ,  and shuts off you ll probably never have a problem . 
that s very accurate and i wish i d paid more attention to that feedback . 
even adjusted to the smallest configuration ,  they are still too big for me . 
the clips on the edges do not fit ,  do not clip ,  it falls apart . 
this did not work well for us at all . 
i should have followed suit but this was a little cheaper . 
the fact that this had baking soda in it really means nothing . 
vibes are not strong so if looking for strong vibes that is not your cup of tea . 
i am thinking maybe keep it in the fridge would be better . 
the sound actually almost sounds as if it came from the console versions . 
unfortunatley my cat does not seem to mind . 
it s not hurting my face ,  but it s not making it better either . 
you drive around to the bad guy and subdue him or kill him . 
maybe i got a defective one ,  but the bag i received was not num_num degrees . 
i bought these mitts for the high reviews but i was insanely disappointed . 
quite frankly the quality of the character models seems of a good dreamcast game ,  or a poor num_extend game . 
first ,  the device should come with an axilliary hook for hanging it . 
it has found a permanent home on my dash . but . 
cashed in my chips and called it quits on the sony . 
i started with a $ krups blade grinder ,  it didn t do the job . 
dark sector s story is boring . don t even spend the money renting the game . 
the quilted lining is thin and pretty minimal . 
you could actually get online and see things people would do and it made it all the more entertaining . 
the second was the same and just quit working after a few weeks . 
i have in and went to the the verision store and bought one that actually works . 
they leak ground spices out of every pore so if possible stick to using them for larger leafy spices . 
i heard they were made in spain ,  however i received a unit which was made in china . 
the second time there was a mess and the clock would not work when i replaced the batteries . 
i have an old watch which sits on the table about num_num feet from me . 
if you want this to just protect your lighter ,  then its perfect . 
the handle doesn t stay upright ,  so the child has to be a good walker to use it . 
i would still only give it about num_num stars though . 
the num_extend i bought doesn t work properly with my omnibook num_extend
the cables in almost all of these have cracked . 
i thought i would get this and carry her in it when she became fatigued . 
it will lighten it even more than that ,  if you can get it all the way through your hair . 
it only takes a few times before they fail . 
the shoulders stick out several inches past the hole where the arm sticks out . 
i had ordered this face cream along with the hand cream and the smell made me sick . 
this brush was defective out of the box . 
there must be a better clipper out there and i ll keep looking . 
you can barely tell what element something is or anything else . 
i was doing all these things while waiting on hold . 
i connected it to three devices and it did not work . 
within a couple of days all it did was click . 
it also stretches ,  which makes it hard to wear in tighter shoes . 
it would do this with all the coins . 
the num_num degree turn will works better as the waste water does not rush directly to the hose seal . 
i finished the entire bottle anyway but the symptoms did not improve . 
you have to fly for minutes to find a enemy ,  and then you have to find nine more . 
taste is king ,  then as long as the flavor pops ,  i look for licorice that is as natural  i . e . 
this is one of the most overrated games of the mario series . 
i replaced the bulbs with the original led s i had installed and will avoid this vendor in the future . 
this compared to the old pointy apple corer . forget this one . 
i disagree with the other haribo fans on this product page . 
in my mind ,  i m owed this as i ve paid for it . 
i have to wonder about safety as some do ,  with all the other deception attached to these things . 
the person that i was speaking with complained about the clarity of my voice . 
graphic is good but not spectacular considering the game being a resource hog . 
well the taste is very salty and extremely bitter . 
again ,  xbox owners get leftovers from a num_extend ported num_extend
because this doesn t even seem like crayola quality . 
the next time i tried to check ,  the phone wouldn t even power on . be warned :  do not buy this product . 
i feel sorry that i purchased this case it s cheap ,  and you have to build it yourself . 
must be afull small feet . this is a very frustrating device . 
all i can sa at this point ,  try at you own risk . 
if the plastic casing piece fit i would rate this a ten plus . 
this product does not work for me compared to other cla products that have tonalin on the label . 
if you read my other reviews ,  i have given mostly positive . 
does not work as well as cheap hot filter from w . a . l . m . a . r . t . 
it doesn t smell horrible ,  but it has a smokey smell to it . 
i am pretty disappointed with this purchase ,  and will be keeping my eye out for better products . 
mine was missing the left channel when new from the package . 
it left me more thirsty than when i finished it . overall not very good . 
some of the speech is still in japanese ,  which is pretty lame they didn t bother to translate it . 
i have been taking the regular mucinex for years whenever i need it with great success . 
does not last long ,  and didn t change my cats  behaviors at all . 
although i have yet to test the sound isolation capability ,  i m really disappointed with its overall sound quality . 
this listing has changed drastically since i ordered mine num_num years ago . 
the red rivets on the zipper fall out of the case . 
i could not cut a single square inch on my back . 
i prefer a stylus that feels more like a pen in my hand . 
this review is for the net wash plus ,  not the actual neti pot . 
the snap closure on this collar is a little too easy to open . 
i ve owned almost every system that has come out ,  and been happy with most of them . 
case did not align up with my samsung num_extend very flexible and cheap . 
there are much sturdier walkers out there and also equipped with better activities than this one !  . 
figured i would then put the rest in my wife s accord . 
i received them all scratched up and they didn t last long before cracking . 
when i turned on the computer it went crazy and burned out the motherboard . 
these are much smaller hence do not fully encompass your ears . 
you shoot and miss ,  and shoot and miss and so on . 
perhaps this is an acquired skill ,  but i can t get the planes to do anything for me . 
thanks amazon readers for posting your helpful information . 
it was rather cheap ,  i ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made !  . 
this product flaked off of my nails within hours of application . 
the first two that came were absolutely filthy ,  having grease marks all over the edges . 
i purchased in store and ended up returning the product . 
i ve tried every type of head and shoulders to help and none work . 
it also burns pretty bad if you apply it after shaving . 
the fist one was doa right out of the package . 
also beware it only takes num_num bb s at a time . 
i only wear them around the house because of the wrinkling bull crap . 
i took this supplement for about num_num days ,  then had pain in the upper right side of my abdomen . 
if i had been the one purchasing this for christmas ,  i would have done way more research . 
don t bother buying this vacuum . your better off with a broom . 
i was almost going to break my phone trying to remove case . 
i would have to bend the cable to make the sound work . 
you can t just plug one adapter in to something else . 
given that leather is a great selling point ,  it s hard to believe that this would not be printed somewhere . 
i would change it to num_num if it were possible . 
i ordered the correct size ,  sports bras are supposed to be somewhat tight . 
also i am plagued by not being able to use my hands very well . 
more like watch some stuff ,  play a little ,  watch more ,  play a little . 
these are the worst thing i have ever gotten from amazon . 
if you are a novice gamer ,  you will get bored with this game . 
now they wanted almost $ to fix it . 
i bought it a sephora so i paid $ instead of the better price here . 
unfortunately ,  this title has that rushed to deadline feel to it and it shows . 
i bought two because i have two cats . 
now it s broken for the third time after having just been repaired num_num months ago . 
the qb ,  when he steps back and throws the ball to the right ,  his arm slings left . 
there s a ton on the butt though ,  and i don t sit back that far on a road bike . 
i would ve shipped it back i lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss . 
only the die hard star wars fans would pick this up . 
it was just plainly so uncomforatble that i stopped using it . 
see review on the chews for petite dogs . 
i love mocha icecream and thought i d love this cafe late bar . 
then adding the black pepper makes it even worse . 
i love green tea ,  i love pomegranate ,  and i love flavored teas . 
but even at this low price ,  a cable should last more than num_num months . 
too bad ,  it fits my phone nicely and is great protection . 
this one is sturdier ,  but since it s not effective for my needs ,  that doesn t help me . 
i`m not sure if i keep it ,  i didn`t want a regular golden color . 
you can go to notre dame and num_extend chicago  a perfect dark reference ?   right next to each other . 
it relieved the pressure of a nodule more than anything ,  which was helpful . 
i d opt for a grinder with rave reviews . 
this case is just too flimsy to case a $ phone . 
this wax seems to shine my black car quite nicely . 
they obviously have no experience or business being in the pci card realm . 
however ,  he s willing to test the model himself and try to get a solution . 
the real ones are really bright without having to charge in the sun . 
i like knorr products and have used them for many years . 
i travel a lot by motorcycle ,  camping half the time . 
i bought this collection for galaga num_extend alone . 
i was very disappointed . even if the music would have great quality ,  i m not sure i d like it much better . 
this screen cover does not adhere to the face of the phone well enough to be useful . 
i am hoping i can give them to a friend or to a rescue group . 
it literally took me num_num hours just to do that battle . 
my carver sunfire center channel speaker over powers these speakers with ease . 
no matter how much praise or how many treats i stuff in their face . 
it is that poor tasting . i know i will never buy it again . 
i don t like thick sleeves that bunch at the elbow while i m driving . 
it took num_num weeks of non use for the itching and swelling to completely go away . 
my next test was to chop my salsa . 
always remember that  natural  and even some  organic  standards depend on how these standards impact profitability . 
you are an edf trooper protecting the world from an alien invasion . 
i was very disappointed with mix num_num in the berry formula . 
every decent strategy game out there ships with multiplayer .  .  . you shouldn t charge more later for what should be included . 
even my last year s camera was much better than this num_extend
feels like its going to break any minute . 
compared to stevita ,  the better stevia packets don t dissolve in cold drinks easily . 
had to return it because it was impossible to get the time right . 
i use end frequently and it should not have been moved . 
i wouldn t say that the controls are that good ,  though . 
very thin ,  thin weave that you can see through if you hold it up to light . 
they are low in fiber ,  with a mere num_num gram ,  and contain num_num grams of carbohydrate . 
does not make a noticable enough difference in sound quality to justify it s cost . 
i ve been using this product effectively for about ten years . 
the shoes do not have enough ventilation for heat . fifth problem . 
the cables pull the door s  up and hold the doors open . 
as soon as i saw the packaging for this product ,  i was skeptical . 
my wife and i gave up on this game after becoming frustrated with it . 
the old pinch collars also just work so much better . 
i was unable to install tge setpoint software that come on the enclosed cd . 
just wanted to go on record as yet another person who is disappointed with this  new  formula . 
the shirt is fine if you like red and with a sateen shine . it is exactly as it is advertised !  !  . 
kinda as if it had been stretched out . 
it s still only compatible with vista  i hated vista  and xp . 
i m shelving it and will update my review once it s fixed enough to play . 
so i ve been going tanning for about a month and a half now using this product . 
i tried this scratcher for my inside only cat and my outside only cat . 
do some research and you will see that other gamers have the same complaint . 
but the gist is this company sells old dead batteries ,  so you probably want to look elsewhere . 
nintendo next year will release their new gamecube . 
not everybody is going to dish out thousands of dollars for an ampliphier or some stereo . 
i usually swear by this stuff so as i said . 
it may work somewhat ,  but i can t handle the greasy feeling on my skin . 
he would pee in the toilet with no problems but this cat takes some pride with his poop . 
just recently got these and let me tell you . 
it almost never worked for my dog  an australian shepherd  . 
even the box for the gopicnic was bulkier then need be . 
this is after i already called our isp to reboot the modem . 
the other pine tar soaps i bought didn t bother me like this one did . 
this holster is very cheap and the plastic clips that holds the phone in place breaks easily . 
spreading it on your bacon is the meat lovers equivalent of the popular chocolate donut with chocolate icing . 
they are not the kind of girls that put there toys on a shelf and leave them there . 
i returned it for the larger model that i like . 
within the first week the metal plates had fallen off . 
loved the colors . then i go check out walmart s mainstay version of this . 
i threw the belt in the trash this morning . 
however ,  even if that hadn t been an issue ,  i still felt like this thing was a piece of junk . 
i used this product on all num_num of my pets ,  all with the same result . 
when i switched makeups ,  my face totally cleared up . 
i kept thinking i must be doing something wrong . 
do not waste you $ took me and my roommate num_num hrs to beat .  :   my money wasted . 
in the picture ,  they look small ,  which would be cool . 
does it matter how good they sound if you can t keep them in your ears ?  . 
i bought these googles for my son who swims competitively . 
i purchased about num_num extra probes for the taylor unit directly from taylor by mail . 
looks fine in the picture ,  but in person it just needs more wires i think . 
avoid this productdoing research on the internet you find out this is dangerous for for use . 
i have always a spare because it s not very secure to the camera . 
how about num_num mg of sodium ?  that exceeds almost all of the common brands of tortilla chips i ve seen . 
warning :  num_num grams of sugar reminds me of the horrible orange drinks they give you for glucose tolerance test . 
now ,  i love my rice sticky but there s a difference between sticky and glumpy .  .  . this was glumpy . 
my bose bt headset just crapped out and i just bought the num_extend
after using it ,  my hair was still tangled and felt like it had nothing on it . 
luckily ,  i have found a cheaper alternative here on amazon that i m not allergic to . 
also ,  the spoken dialog is heard about num_num seconds prior to the character s mouths actually moving . 
most of the plastic continues to break of every time i use it . 
silly ,  silly me . the one benefit of this is that it s rather simple to add to the ipad . 
so glad i didn t go to bed with it on not realizing the issue with this new formula . 
the scoll wheel is crude ,  and you can actually count the notches as you scroll . 
all is good except the outlet hole is too small . it would be perfect if they made the hole bigger . 
it does a superb job of creating a creepy environment for you to play in . 
boy was i wrong !  it looks like a piece of crap once assembled . 
had this machine one day before returning it . 
i bought a $ osterizer and it s a little smaller but does ice quickly and well without problems . 
don t make the same mistake i made by purchasing this . 
here are my comments regarding each set : garnet :  too dark . 
i d pick a plan toys train set instead . 
if you notice the picture of it shows it holding a ringed binder . 
the fragrance of the so called shea butter is quite intense . 
i really wish i had seen the reviews before i purchased num_extend
the blade bends ,  in my opinion ,  too num_extend
we ran over and pulled out a large wad of threads from his mouth and throat . 
unless you have money to burn ,  i d pass this one by . 
i was surprised how bulky the gloves were ,  they looked thin and elegant online . 
omg i m so in love with this cream . first off ,  the ingredient list is all natural ,  no toxic additives . 
so i just bought this based on the bb sales rep s recommendation . 
it lingers forever ,  long after you ve finished your last sip and it s not very pleasant . 
perhaps someone with bad taste will appreciate this terrible game . 
it seems to make the eyelashes soft ,  but so far not any length or thickening . 
they were dried out . you can t directly control the moisture locked in the dry kernels; only the manufacturer can . 
during an average cutscene ,  the graphics look a tad choppy . 
challenge yourself to get num_num stars on every fight and it s a good action game . 
i just glued it back together ,  but it can t swivel anymore . 
this use to be a fairly good product . 
there is one more thing you should know . 
i hadn t read the ingredients until after i made it . 
i love the original mocha chip balance bars . 
i purchased this device from staples as a christmas present for my wife . 
the man i bought them for doesn t like them . 
it literally ripped off my skin ,  and left me with bruises . 
let the casual players play madden s franchise mode . 
at least they do a better job at game design . 
i got these for guppies ,  but the guppies couldn t eat them . 
then the top around my ribs it was too big . 
i bought this ball for my hyper lab and mixed terrier . 
i love herbal teas ,  and thought this was a ginger tea . 
i purchased this item because there re good review . 
i was hoping for the larger oxo handle like the paring knife . 
well ,  now it is damaged . the only remaining plus for this unit is the vcr . 
my vet suggested one of these based on her assumption that my dog is anxious . 
many products contain chemicals and other ingredients that are dangerous and can cause severe allergic reactions . 
i tasted no vanilla ,  and the coffee itself was very bitter for a medium roast . 
contacted citi and they wanted me to send a picture of the cable . 
would not order this item again it does not really protect cell from breaking if dropped  :   . 
the only problem i have is the gun does not feel secure . 
this causes my feet to slide forward when i walk . 
what i do is this : i use the double fold method and put it in as the directions say to . 
a shame too ,  because it was not cheap . 
what a mess !  i m so ,  so ,  so upset with this cleaner . 
the ramp pieces just would not stay connected . 
spend the extra num_num bucks and get a real cutting board . 
we went out and spent $ and bought some clippers from our vet ,  which are much sharper . 
i bought num_num blades and am stuck for a while . another gillette marketing gimmick that ,  for me ,  does not deliver . 
but lever backs don t match up . so the first time i wore them i lost one . shame as they are lovely . 
this should have arrived on monday the num_extend it is now the num_extend and it still has not arrived . 
it s exactly what i m looking for but no way will i pay such a criminal shipping charge . 
this does not dissolve completely even with hot water . 
i bought this to hook up a metronome to an amp . 
the first night i set them up they worked perfectly for num_num hours . 
it has a one year warrantee so this is destined for the trash  or for freecycle  . 
party is able to overthrow the emporer .  .  . yep that s about it . 
it does have a nice scent ,  which dissipates in a matter of hours . 
num_extend are very unconfortable . i would not buy again them . 
hope this helps any trying this for that reason . 
this tripod is suitable for a small digital camera . 
i also bought moving comfort women s fiona bra and i love it great support . 
if your cold is cured after taking these for just two weeks ,  well ,  great i guess . 
get a separate pasta machine ,  the stainless steel kind that breaks the pasta down into sheets of thickness . 
worse than the one that was in the phone . 
drm concerns and stability issues  again  to name a couple of issues . 
after my logitec mouse died from abuse ,  i was looking for a comfortable precise mouse . 
i am an avid coffee drinker ,  and i use this pot everyday . 
i immediately contacted adorama and requested a refund and paid return shipping as well as the correct product . 
this dog food contains mostly corn and disgusting animal digest  slaughter house scraps like hooves ,  hair ,  feathers ,  etc  . 
i boughta replacement batteryand installed it ,  then charged it up . 
the other doll s hands are super flexible andso are the legs but without a chance of breaking . 
after washing and drying ,  i held the shirt next to one of my medium hanes  longsleeve pullovers . 
i am hungry and i can not open any cans . 
then again ,  i have serious sleep problems and have kind of surpassed a lot of natural remedies . 
glad amazon has such great shipping and return policies . 
whoever said  not only is it not vegetable soup ,  it s not even soup  was perfectly right . 
tested it against two others and it always showed the plant as being more wet than it really was . 
i grind my own beans and try as often as possible to purchase fairly traded beans . 
we submitted for a return and have switched to another brand . 
when the vehicle is flipped ,  the controllers control the same wheels ,  but the wheel positions are reversed . 
this causes the contents to loose potency almost immediately . 
when it comes to wrinkles ,  well more aggressive procedures need to be applied . 
i m a huge star wars fan ,  and i pretty much have ever game with star wars in the title . 
i hate using drugs but in this case it is worth it . 
he wore them on the weekends to break them in but that didn t work . 
i tried these based on the reviews and they were very stiff ,  plastic feeling and generally uncomfortable . 
or ,  you will find yourself trying to baste quickly ,  before it runs out of the tube . 
it is very cheap looking and not worth the price . 
so obviously i never got to use it ,  but i was unimpressed with the overall quality . 
my other teapots with infuser baskers don t have this problem . 
the older ones had battery covers that would not stay on however . 
when i attempted to pull them farther up my waist to find more room ,  i received an instant wedgie . 
i have already replaced the purse and would not recommend it . 
they do not even pass the most cursory visual comparison to a genuine motorola battery . 
num_extend +  it still does not seem as strong as the young living . 
too much effort for a one week solution . 
rent it and find out for yourself ,  but save your pocketbook some cash . 
may as well just press the button on the itouch to change tracks . 
the next num_num or num_num levels were the same . 
but at this price you would think the packaging would be better . 
the bottle says to apply over three   !   coats of base coat . 
my way of hitting is to just swing and see what happens . 
i don t really like the taste of this compared to sugar . 
it needs to be a whole lot num_extend
i found it hard to peel off the individual paper wrappers without leaving bits of candy stuck to them . 
aren t i supposed to be in the same base as gordon freeman ?  oh wait ,  i guess i am . 
no ,  i would not recommend ,  and yeah ,  the panties are bikinis and show threw your clothes . 
i wanted to see mars and a good look at the rings of saturn . 
the size xl runs too small  more like a l  . 
cushioning ,  is hard and it took only few seconds to begin hurting my ears . 
i have wanted this mixer for probably num_num years now . 
it didn t detox me like it claims it supposed to do . 
i used a sharpie and traced the outside holes onto the the inside section . 
that in itself was weird since i have never used a body wash like that . 
anyway ,  after using num_num screen protectors ,  i had to accept my fate . 
the product was difficult to install and did not cover the corners of my phone . 
first it has a light grayish color to it . 
the list includes this item as well as the others listed . 
i know nothing pushed on the reset button . 
but the fm reception is so bad that this radio is worthy of only num_num stars . 
i wish the device had come with some kind of instructions or support . 
they are over a month old ,  and i will probably just wash them down the drain . 
basically they seem to be crispy green peas . 
since when did they stop sealing ?  the top seemed to be on snug but obviously it wasn t . 
so i ordered this style in the same size . 
i picked up an old stereo receiver for $
i would skip this and just use the controller . 
that said ,  the gun has a lot of nice features . 
needless to say i am still buying pam spray . 
they are still wearable ,  but i really only put them on if my other two pairs are dirty . 
i would save your money and get something without any moving parts . 
the eyes at the top can close and clip baby while they re playing with it . 
upon putting the case on my phone ,  it snapped the power button out . 
would notrecommend unless you keep out of sun . 
it s too bad they did look like nice speakers ,  a little big ,  but well made . 
the sleeve for the nano split num_num seconds into sliding it on . 
this bra has this weird extra nipple room that i did not need . 
i got the brown and it is truly the most unattractive color ever . 
i have been on and off dying and getting professional highlights for years . 
the metal they used tastes bad like they used old tin cans or something ,  and they were flimsy . 
maybe something that expanded when wet or was thick enough to do the job with just one . 
they don t stretch around the band and are consequently very uncomfortable . 
the colors are also very hard to blend . 
i think using a tinted moisturizer is easier to use then this stuff . 
now i see why so many people complained bitterly about these treatments . all of the brands . 
everything echoes for some reason when you go down hills of streets {shrug} . 
they slip off just like normal bobby pins . 
i bought it when it first came out and realized that the num_extend price tag was way over priced . 
my former frother lasted some num_num years before i wore it out . 
partition magic  . if the problem is with the bios  and not the os  then upgrade the bios . 
i ve been using the product for almost num_num months now . 
i can t even get more than halfway through the first training mission without the game crashing . 
this food has truly been an awful experience and i will not be buying anymore . 
its sad since they used to be my go to company . 
i ordered these after reading the ingredient list posted by amazon and concluding they were vegan . 
i think oxo should stick to extrusion plastic goods and stay away from wood products . 
i purchased this phone from the best buy website . 
one strand has already unraveled . this has been reviewed after one week of use . 
i did do alot of research on this coffee pot and thought the  overflow  issue wouldn t happen to me . 
rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat . 
i would rather do without coffee than to drink this . 
it s quite fun to try and match the songs to the characters . 
i understand that the num_extend is aging hardware ,  but i ve seen some damn beautiful games run perfectly on it . 
when i went to pull the tab to remove the phone ,  nothing happened . 
still no one could hear me talking and what they did hear sounded like an echo . 
i have had this product for approximately num_num years . 
downfall was that the cable only worked for a couple weeks then it completely before it stopped completely . 
overall ,  a disappointing purchase that i wouldn t recommend . 
although i bought these pedals along with mountain bike cycling shoes ,  the fit was poor . 
i found my skin was sensitive and it darken my skin . a . l . 
the mat should be connected to earth ground or placed on a grounded surface . 
besides the deadweight allies ,  the difficulty curve for this game is broken . 
i like that is is very easy to clean and fill . 
unfortunately it s a spell ,  so you have to spend mana on it . 
when one turns off the unit ,  it forgets where it was playing . 
then ,  as others have mentioned ,  the temperature dial started sticking . 
they re also about $ cheaper than the ctc lasers . i do not work for  or against  either company . 
this product did not work well at all . 
not even one month ,  it was borken already ,  and i don t really use it that often . 
you can t move your phone from vertical to horizontal position without using both hands . 
if you have an average sized forearm ,  you shouldn t have a problem . 
the eye relief is still num_num and i must take my glasses off . 
does not work . kind of sad it didnt though ,  still have half a bottle left . 
and i guess all of you too  .  .  . after all  ,  i dont think that the toxic cyanid . 
it is the loudest ,  most obnoxious sound you ll ever num_extend
the gameshark intercooler would get a num_num star rating ,  because it works as advertised . 
and the lid covering the grinding chamber is screwed on so no more leaky mess . 
the cursor doesn t always respond well ,  and is very frustrating . 
for the life of me ,  i can t see why this game got so many great reviews . 
i opened it up and was very surprised at how cheap the attachments were . 
i have two now ,  because ihave one for each cat . 
i do not recommend this product for any reason . 
linksys tech support can t offer any solutions that you can t read off their website . 
no accommodation has been made for the extra attachment . 
i had to shell out money for a facial with extractions to clear everything out . 
it still didn t work  live and learn ,  i guess . 
it s their poor design and not the store s fault who sold it . 
the reason i bought this was the heart rate function . 
the back of the heel is too low and the shoe easily slips off at the back . 
way too much money for the quality that it is . 
you never quite can get things done rapidly enough in or out of battle . 
buying from amazon was not the best choice in saving money . 
i really didn t want the money and just wanted the unit replaced . 
i ordered the motorola roadster num_num after owning the original num_extend motorola hands free car speakerphone for several years . 
you press different buttons on your controller in different combinations to perform your tasks . 
i just received my brand new uncle mike s deluxe range bag today . 
even while i m trying to put this game together it s falling apart . 
i tried to take it apart ,  but you can t without breaking it . 
i chose to sell it instead of starting over again . 
they don t break well and don t seem to have a high value for the dogs . 
i finally found a food that does not cause gas .

this game is annoying ,  it will tick you off . 
it has sugar in it !  awful ,  awful ,  awful . 
first ,  the esrb rating system should either be trashed or severely reformed . 
another major downfall is always having a darn yankee on the cover .

for me it was a waste of money . 
don t know if its salicylic acid itself or if its the company s formulation . 
it used to be the best wax on the market ,  they must have changed the ingredients . 
then as i was removing the product the pain began in other fingers on both hands . 
there was no way these would be wearable for a day at the office . 
unlike others ,  i don t think it s an earth shattering design . 
park told me to buy a professional wrench if it is used often to remove pedals that were overtighted . 
there is little i can say that won t duplicate what others have said . 
amazon should take this product out of its site . 
they even came out way before this dud . 
the price isn t bad for what it gives . 
the self clean indicator is a joke . i would suggest that anyone looking at this expensive model ,  look elsewhere . 
this is just an example of sega cashing in on the wii hype back than . 
that s about it however . i would also look at other reviews . 
it s super cheap and fits very loosely on my car air vent . 
the chips themselves are ok ,  without a reliable way to transport them this poker set isn t worth much . 
i researched bluetooth s and this one was supposed to be the best ,  what a joke . 
too bad we bought it when it first came out . 
especially when the really good variety is available . 
and so far i tried twice but it doesnt really show any color on my face . 
i was first very disappointed by the smell . 
i have two of these ,  and my kids do not like wearing them .

after about a week ,  the whole basement was a little clearer . 
i wasn t expecting much because theprice was so low . 
it is generic product ,  but worth every single penny . 
this headset can take a lot of abuse . 
just the right size for the in between jobs . 
battery life is a little less than other phones we have had but still lasts all day . 
if you want a fun way to protect your phone ,  this is the way . 
very small but it works great in the car . 
i can hear a noticeable amount of hiss and loss of clarity . 
then i worried about the quality and whether or not it would look cheap and flimsy .

i don t see how you can beat that . 
i had been looking for a long time and i am delighted with the set . 
the dogtag chain relieves strain from the earbuds and can be hidden discreetly under your shirt . 
i don t own much expensive cookware ,  although i wish i could afford it . 
from a distance i have people say they could not tell that it was a phone case !  . 
first ,  one corner of the case doesn t snap on real well ,  and when dropped ,  it pops off a little . 
for the price ,  this knife does the job . 
best case out there for an extended battery . 
just have to be patient in installing ,  also have really steady hands . 
i did a lot of research before buying this processor . 
nice pan !  this pizza pan is a great size . 
i don t mind that and just get another one . 
does require a bit of guess work ,  but still not difficult . 
this is the best blade grinder i have found . 
great item ,  highly rated by my fave cooking mag from the east coast that has a pbs tv show . 
i m sure they will stay fresher in the jars than in the bag with a close pin . 
you would think the description would say  hose sold separately  or something to that effect . 
i really loved it and will use it alot . 
we got this kit for our daughters num_extend birthday kit to make her cake . 
not totally regularly shaped ,  and look a little cheap . 
love the quality stainless ,  as well as the long slender design . 
while i own a ceramic sharpening device ,  i still haven t had to use it on either knife . 
look great !  neutral to go with any curtain color . 
the nonstick coating is just as good ,  if not better than other commercial grill pans . 
charge performance is quick and handles all that i throw at it . 
the water is just as tasteless ,  but the flow is much better . 
this roughness allows for food to stick on the skillet more than on those other types of skillets . 
most of this can be resolved by rooting the phone and putting a custom rom on num_extend
nice cover ,  cheap price ,  easy to install ,  fit the motorola photon perfect . 
i can roast vegetables quickly in it ,  and even bake muffins . 
there were campsites where i was the only one with cell service .

you have evenly cooked ,  crispy pizzelles in no time . 
so i was happy to find this ,  seasoned it and used it a few times ,  now it s perfect . 
pour boiling water into the bottom reservoir  with bottom filter removed  ,  one half inch from the top . 
we re using ciao bella book of gelato and highly recommend the purchase of this book with the lello . 
fits very well and is durable plastic for good protection .

blade is really sharp and got the results that i was expecting . 
after looking around at other products like this such as the incipio feather and casemate barely there . 
this vornado heater is pure luxury to me . 
my husband usually uses my hand mixer beater to whisk sauces . 
this machine is easy to use ,  just plug and go . 
however ,  the overall sound quality both ways is better and the fit is more comfortable than the jawbone . 
this will be my second of these scrapers . 
don t give this amazing tool a bad review just because you were sent a different model . 
not a big deal ,  but much larger than i expected . 
i am very happy with the purchase and the installation was easy . 
i have owned any number of strainers over the years ,  but never one like this . 
it seems that all of the family didn t have enough chargers . 
they re my favorite glasses for serving up mixed drinks . 
it really just sits lightly over your ear . 
it comes with a dough hook too even though i didn t see it in the description . 
i liked it so much ,  i ordered an additional one for my hubby . 
i bought this on amazon quite some time ago . 
everyone recommends this knife ,  so no one will read this comment . 
very highly recommended because of their quality and how heavy and sturdy the glass is . 
i was familiar with corelle already so i knew they would never break or chip . 
i purchased a few of these to keep at different locations . 
it s not like real espresso ,  but it gets as close as you can for very little money . 
the meat is only partially thawed when i slice it ,  but it works great . 
i bought this pan specifically to make corn bread . 
the wide top reduces and concentrates flavors amazingly fast . 
great price and it noticeably filters tap water that i can smell coming out of the faucet . 
i needed this for canning items that don t do well with oxygrn absorbers like sugar . 
for this price $ for what looks like same case in mall  it is a real winner . 
i ve been a fan of otterbox products for a long time . 
give it a chance ,  you won t be disappointed !  . 
i wanted to make strawberry and i had some frozen ones that i had thawed . 
who knew .  .  .  . i followed both machine recipes for basic bread . 
it is easy to use and fits the iphone num_num great . 
i can t speak for the white one but the black one did crack around the volume buttons . 
this is a manuel machine ,  but it works great . 
wish i didn t have to buy two though . 
i needed a set with a goldtone accent to go with my gold rimmed plates . 
this pan performed great searing and then braising of pork chops . 
this machine just keeps on brewing and frothing . 
oh ,  by the way .  .  . you can wash these holsters ,  too . 
the extra life of these batteries was overrated . 
i wish there was an option for better than perfect service as this company deserves it . 
this is good since you would have to convert your own recipes to the above proportions . 
they are very comfortable in your ears and people can hear you very well . 
but ,  a huge disappointment was the lid !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  the paperwork that came with the jar says made in the usa . 
five days a week we use the beeps as our alarm clock . 
so ,  it won t bother me when i work . 
being a mom of small kids ,  i can certainly say :  can not do without it . 
it also will tell you when you have turned it off . 
i have given several way as gifts and they were all pleased . 
practical tips for quick and sure assembly :  num_extend
i have bought two additional ones for gifts and have had dozens more bought by my recommendation . 
my first tuna asparagus creeps in cream sauce were a success . 
it looks great and i hang most of my pots and pans from it .  .  . and we re talking cast iron here . 
it grinds grains without making too much noise . 
awesome stylus !  perfect weight ,  size and love this type of tip . 
iced tea machine for many years ,  but i think this product is far superior . 
i really like how sturdy they are and how clear they look . 
worth buying a few or more to have in the car ,  briefcase ,  house and whatnot . 
so ,  you always have to have a hot pad or towel num_extend
i hastily ordered her another one and it arrived on time . 
they really are invalueable and worth every penny . 
the price is right and so is the item . try it , you ll like it too . 
they give you everything you need and its worth the price although the iphone shield prices are pretty good . 
but i ve seen many people with this so thought i would give it a try . 
i thought it would be hard to replace but watched video on youtube and worked out fine . 
dust ,  sand ,  dog hair ,  cat hair and a leaf . 
shaped a little weird ,  but is an awesome fan . 
the excellent instruction manual that comes with this cooker lists appropriate cooking times for many kinds of food . 
it isn t very convenient though compared to a real lid . 
they proceed faster when the wine is warm and slow down when it s cool . 
these knives are made in china from stamped stainless steel ,  as indicated in the specs . an explanation :  j . a . 
very durable and total molded design is great . 
it charges anything that uses usb ,  just like you d expect . 
also it is larger than it looks in the picture !  . 
i have purchased these for gifts as well . 
i m an avid amateur cook ,  and love entertaining . 
this product is excellent and unlike the comment in one review ,  i have noticed no plastic taste . 
frost color looks nice on the cell phone and feels durable . 
this is extremely important to avoid any num_extend the lid grip is thin and hard to remove . 
guess it has been a while since i had used or needed a double boiler ?  !  . 
most new phones are going to soft buttons . 
they gave me a week to see if any more problems popped up . 
looks brand new ,  already made a few things and it seems to work perfectly . 
a year and a half with two kids and no casualties so far . 
i love just looking at it ,  but i love it even more using it . 
there needs to be room at the top of kettle to contain boiling water . 
the price was right and it came very quickly after i ordered it . 
and a quicker path through the filter results in incomplete brewing ,  and ,  bitterness . 
the sound is alright but they are good because they block outside sounds . 
when my old one finally rusted away  after num_num years  ,  i was thrilled to find this as a replacement . 
i m saving my receipt and if that happens i ll be very disappointed . 
i have gotten no complaints from people i call and am on the phone a lot . 
i am a first time user so am not an expert . 
it still cooks great and cleans as easy as it did new . 
do it right and it will make a nice seal . 
it also allows sending text messages through desktop  when phone is connected  . 
it works like a charm and you really get a very similar product . 
this little tool is perfect and can t understand why i never invested in one before . 
seems to be in great condition ,  arrived very quickly . 
all stainless ,  so don t worry about wearing anything out . 
i changed screen protectors twice i believe in a matter of nearly a year . 
this was an easy fix up for the board . 
will review again when i have more experience with it . 
this knife was no exception to that; razor sharp out of the box . 
i have tried all manner of other ways to integrate my iphone easily with my car . 
this is about the same size with the same size screen . 
if you own a evo you should own this as well . 
i ordered a trailer ball and it was in the same box packed loose . 
nice and heavy ,  very solid and easy to use because of the heft . 
the incredible was a great phone for the most part but it ate through battery . 
but this headset works really well and also obviously can stand up to some unique challenges . 
yeah ,  i complain about cleaning it ,  but as far as juicers go ,  this one is easy to clean . 
i even wrote to krups and was not given any explanation . 
this one was just as good as my old one !  i was so glad !  . 
i thought they were so cute i even put one on my daddy s ipad . 
to activate discoverable mode you simply press and hold the call button until the bluetooth indicator starts flashing . 
i bought these because my zaggs wouldn t stay on while running . 
the key .  .  . you have to remove the phone from the case ,  which is very inconvenient !  . 
the key number to pay attention to is the second one ,  the rated amperage . 
i got the recommendation from cooks illustrated ,  and it works like a charm . 
i paired it to my cell phone in a matter of seconds with absolutely no problems . 
this is very nice i had to register this handset . 
it is a nice heavy glass and if used for what it was intended for it will last forever . 
i would never have even thought about purchasing anything that was reconditioned until i read the reviews here . 
i m hoping we have many years of trouble free use with this machine . 
i use these with iphone num_extend and a blackberry curve+ auto shutoff after the phone moves out of range . 
the light indicators for the battery life and connection status are wonderful . 
will work well with cheese ball and crackers or small slices of pound cake ,  etc . 
i bought this one because the original cable i had was ripping apart . 
it works for my iphone num_num that needed a new battery . 
i switch battery s often so i need to be able to remove the cover easily . 
i highly recommend them and for the price i don t see how you could beat them . 
the back plate offers great protection and new charging options . 
very handy ,  size is great but everytime i use ,  it seems to take a little bit more finish off . 
compare vendors shipping charges as well as the unit price for your best purchase price . 
that is a bit awkward but eventually it worked . 
if you take good care of the cast iron dutch oven ,  it ll serve you very well and your generations . 
it is a classic design that is beautiful enough to leave out in the open . 
but the thing is ,  i don t think they should bend . 
it s sturdy and well made ,  i m very happy with the purchase . 
i need to up my game to keep up with my new board . 
i have had my cuisinart machine for num_extend years . 
she had been using an otterbox commuter but was dissatisfied with that case s bulk . 
when i look at its picture while ordering i never think it should be same as in the pics . 
i mounted some cambridge soundworks surround speakers on the stands with no problems . 
i am very attached to certain wooden spoons .  .  . i use different spoons for different sorts of stirring . 
the outside chrome part ,  does get very hot . 
and they make the phone easier to grip while protecting the surface . 
voice guide is great and answering with my voice is faster than i though . 
of course ,  you ll probably figure that out for yourself . 
this is a must have for anyone who has a cell phone . 
charges my nokia num_extend at a fairly fast rate . 
one being the loudness of the unit seemed a tad low ,  and the fit didn t seem quite right . 
i had no feeding or jamming problems whatsoever . my only issue with this device is using it to stuff sausages . 
excellent peeler ! so many peelers just don t work that well . 
i gave it the benefit of the doubt and used it anyway . 
for me ,  this handle is too big ,  and i feel like my wrist is an awkward angle . 
great quality stainless steel ,  good weight ,  nice looking !  i love all the oxo products i have . 
is it a wonder why this coffee grinder is rated number num_extend
its a neck lanyard which is pretty standard . 
i just received this guy yesterday and tried it out last night with a large sweet potato . 
the turkey fit nicely in the pan and came out very moist and flavorful . 
it is basically just a big luggage tag ,  but it does an adequate job . 
update :  my newest sanyo microwave convection oven quit after working for a little over two years . 
i highly recommend it !  you will not be disappointed . 
as for the pan itself ,  i couldn t be happier with it . 
the flashlight is not very bright ,  i would say about as bright as a keychain flashlight ,  if that . 
you release the lock mechanism at the top and press down . 
use wooden or plastic utensils and you won t scratch the finish . 
the blender does what a usual blender is supposed to do . 
but ,  i would not suggest blending anything hard  like ice  in a canning jar . 
i bought num_num sizes of the golden holiday tablecloth and matching place mats . 
what a well made docking device !  this was one of the fastest shipped items i have purchased from amazon . 
my only complaint is the latch that keeps it shut ,  is a little aggrivating . 
everything sticks and it s a bear to clean . 
you can also rotate it to fit it in your left or right ear . 
it is really handy !  my cabinet was a mess and this helped me to get things better organized . 
i thought it would be a little tricky to clean the blades but it couldn t be easier . 
cost $ and had plenty to choose from . 
i love the blade cover; that s probably my favorite part about this . 
i was able to sync this within about num_num minute to my droid num_extend
there are different types of burr grinders but the conical type is supposed to be the best . 
everything fits perfectly in the case and it makes everything much neater . 
i love the look of this charger first off . 
for the oat flour .  .  . also use an equal amount of whole wheat flour .  .  . i have been using  quakers   old fashion oats  . 
the agility has a removable hood making this area easy to clean . 
otherwise ,  the calls seem good on this plantronics num_extend bluetooth earpiece . 
a also like the web strap underneath it fits about num_num wash cloths . 
this pan is a wonderful addition to my calphalon collection . 
they are sturdy yet beautiful ,  and are the perfect size for pasta ,  casseroles ,  rice dishes ,  and more . 
the numbers on each are etched solidly into the rubber handgrips ,  ensuring they won t disappear anytime soon . 
this phone is really cool and i recommend it for anyone looking for a bad ass phone . 
great for cutting ,  chopping and scraping ,  i wonder what i used to use before i got one of these . 
i ve only used these pans a few times ,  so far ,  but they re working out great . 
at its current price of less than $ it s really a steal as well . 
most of the time ,  the person on the other side didn t notice that i was on a bluetooth . 
the powerful motor is more than enough for any job . 
it s had the best crema on my espresso this side of italy . 
i just loved the colors when i saw this and had to have it . 
the chopsticks are nice ,  and come with grips on them for extra  grabbing  power . 
my charger works just fine .  .  . it charges my phone quickly . 
they fit on very snugly ,  and the screen is just as sensitive as when the phone is bare . 
and then there are the general uses ,  the logical ones that come to mind .  .  . closing bags of chips and crackers . 
buy more than you think you need ,  you ll use  em . 
the sound quality is amazing for music and phone conversations . 
don t put in ear while crazy glue is wet . 
only a percolator perfectionist would really notice that difference . 
after that i gave the slicer another chance . 
highly recommend these to people to use on their whiteboards or refrigerators . 
i have purchased these glasses num_num times now to have them engraved for going away gifts . 
used this to shove into doughnut holes  i cheated on actual cake pops  . 
this was a really good price for the cord . 
sometimes i have to keep mobile in dusty places . 
there is no  jumping around  of the appliance on the counter when it s in use . 
there is a size or two up that i like the best from oxo however . 
i like this sifter especially for making cakes that require folding in sifted ingredients in portions at a time . 
it eliminates sediment and any traces of bitterness . 
this one was at a great price and it works well . 
and even better ,  nobody can compare with kitchenaid s customer service care centeer . 
i had never defrosted anything in a microwave that didn t get cooked on the edges until now . 
it s ideal for those recipes that combine measures ,  e . g .  ,   one cup plus two tablespoons of sugar  . 
brita makes a great product ,  and the price on amazon makes it worth buying here . 
i d recommend it for anyone that wants easy access to their credit cards and id . 
if you love apples and pears ,  this is a must have tool . 
that s the only reason i didn t give it five stars . 
i personally have no need for a kickstand so this works great . 
i ve had my case for about num_num months now and use it everyday . 
rv s are subject to much dust not to mention we change environments  pollen types  on a continuing basis . 
as a former commercial meat cutter i ve had years of experience with this type product . 
we have used it every day for a month . 
would recommend it to anyone who s a user of ram mount products . 
upon switching to the iphone num_extend it has continued to work . 
the curved shape of the premier is the shape of this little processor . 
the plastic will have some staining over time but doesn t effect the use of the product . 
many have complained about the lid or the product being thin and easily breakable . 
wow ,  i was so wrong ! the popcorn maker comes in num_num simple to assemble parts and then the cardboard concentrator . 
i do hand wash ,  immediately after use and then dry . 
i was pleasantly surprised when the product arrived and did indeed have a brushed finish . 
i assure you that the product is as good as these reviews claim . 
the pots has a nice weight to them . 
the discovery num_num seemed to fit the bill . 
i was so happy i bought the regular jar sealer also . 
it is just so much nicer to be able to grind spices with one hand . 
works effortlessly to make smooth ,  thin sheets of pasta . 
this is a must have for the phones . 
as many folks out there ,  including anthony bourdain i too was scared of pressure cookers . 
no soap or abrasive cleaners of any kind . 
so when i saw this num_num on sale ,  i thought i was upgrading . 
i m glad when i did ,  i chose a boos . 
it fits all jars perfectly and cans well . 
protects my phone and it s simple to put on and take off . 
i bought the bodum because i like the looks better and it costs less . 
saves time ,  space and just plain awesome for those of us that can . 
so i decided to get myself a second one . 
extremely well made with every size imaginable in a handly storage tin for a very reasonable price . 
the challenge for me was making the drink hot enough . 
much cheaper than the apple version and works just as well . 
this fit his phone perfectly !  both of us are pleased with the purchase . 
i owned the old version of this same brand and model which served me well for num_extend years . 
cant wear it on my ears with my glasses without adjusting it some since thats uncomfortable . 
you just cut lemon in half ,  and press it on the top of the juicer . 
haven t dropped it yet ,  so hopefully it will hold up . 
i like the vocalyst service as well ,  even though i don t use it often . 
i have the time and the inclination to can again . 
the shipment was recieved on time ,  it worked for blackberry num_num car charger . 
i love that i can take it from vehicle to vehicle with me . 
it is very easy to use and has all the necessary things to make it a very handy product . 
i am happy with the order and you will be too . 
i asked for this for christmas so i could make tea at my desk at work . 
the lip on the top makes for pain free pressing for continued use . 
these are the best forks i have ever found for crab legs . 
we have num_num of these pots at church . 
it is great for traveling and using the map app . 
i have bought a couple as gifts and always have a replacement on hand . 
i did and this was the closest to my old one . 
as always with cuisinart ,  quality goods !  grinds the beans quickly and easy to clean . 
i have thrown out many others ,  i always have two on hand . 
the soft plastic lid seals tight enough to use it as a shaker . 
i got this originally for under $  used   came sealed in it s package ,  though  . 
but .  .  .  . now i am getting a new one . i have had this product for about a year and a half . 
this counter undercount is awesome and i have more counter room . 
i ve called ,  but haven t reached a clueful cingular support rep yet . 
we have had these same shears for years . 
i would never have thought i would switch brands but so far ,  so good with the kitchen aid . 
really liked how grippy the sides of the phone are . 
i normally go though cases in a few months . 
recommended for people who cook small to medium amounts of rice at least two times a week . 
each glass size ended being exactly what i like . 
great versatility with the usb port that could charge any device . 
over num_num years ago i used a pressure cooker on a regular basis . 
they are to the t and if followed the likelyhood of messing up is slim . 
i use this in between with just hot water . 
get it hot ,  just be fore it starts to smoke ,  add your rice . 
thanks to the seller for sending me a quality  new  product . 
it is clean and it locks  the lock is a little tricky to work  . 
they re made of glass so they behave more like pyrex in the microwave . 
nice design ,  easy to assemble and decent quality . 
about this product because of the low price . 
i am hoping it will last her through several years ,  but we will have to wait and see . 
the num_num cup capacity has always been more than enough for my family of three as well . 
i got this phone num_num weeks after its launch mid june num_extend using it daily ,  and just about every feature . 
i ve heard they are great with repairs if you need one . 
it won t wreck it .   this thing cooks everything we ve thrown in it perfectly . 
the only thing better would have been getting a new mixer . 
however ,  i have become used to the screen appearance and like the way that this protector works . 
to be honest ,  i m pretty neutral about these . 
even if you only use it to dice garlic ,  it is worth owning . 
this is a very nice pepper grinder in a sea of junk grinders . 
it works great for reheating soup or making instant oatmeal . 
and is the best quality cast iron cookware made . 
great coffee maker and very easy to use . 
this cup set lets you see the size with ease thanks to the larger number on the handle !  . 
it s actually num_num cents cheaper now in num_num than it was when i bought it in num_extend
first i like that the whole chassis is stainless steel . 
practical and ingenious ,  we use it all the time . 
this one is ,  but it ll wear away the nonstick properties faster ,  so handwashing is recommended . 
i love cast iron and this is my go to pot for baking my crusty bread . 
it s much cheaper to buy your first items in a kit ,  rather than individually . 
the size of the pan was perfect ,  and i was also pleased with the roasting rack included . 
it recharges quickly and i make sure it s always ready to go . 
these arrived and are a little short but they work perfectly . 
it was very helpful to have the number of cups needed for each pan plainly described on the packaging . 
these make nice gifts that won t break the bank . 
keep in mind that it is slow so plan on charging overnight with it . 
i will not have my iphone until april . 
after several drops the case has yet to come flying off as many of the hard cases do . 
i won t take a star away just for preference . 
i own several timers and this is my favorite . 
works perfectly and much better than non htc charger on my hct phone . 
the audio is great and people never complain about not hearing me . 
excellent num_extend stars instead of num_num because of the price . 
it s also a bit heaver then normal headphones because of the batteries . 
this is one that the quality was just as sweet as the quantity . 
we all can use one charger instead of having multiple chargers all over the place . 
i bought this for my motorola droid num_extend
i like the dual plug in style on the charger that includes usb access . 
it turns out that making yogurt is easy; just follow the included directions . 
everyone loves this juicer ,  and they are easy to use and clean . 
that s just the nature of cast iron cookware . 
the disposal cup is large enough and easy to empty and reinstall on the vacuum . 
it has never failed to open what i needed opened . 
i recommend them to anyone needing great value for the money . 
i bought this otterbox case because the defender is too bulky . 
i bought this because it happened to be top rated based off a youtube video i saw . 
all of my reviews on the chicago metallic bakeware are going to look much the same . 
and the steel just didn t conduct the heat to my satisfaction . 
it took num_num hours to bring it to full charge . the ipad num_num was at num_num percent capacity . 
otherwise i can find no fault with the cup . 
i do have a few scratches on the protector screen ,  but that s what its there for . 
zucchini ,  cucumbers ,  cabbage ,  sweet potatoes ,  etc you can t feed faster the chute faster than this machine can work . 
this is compact ,  and does a good job of grinding . 
i bought these gloves so that i could use an iphone when it s cold . 
this was a cheap solution to my problem . 
arrived undamaged and no broken wire like other reviewers stated . 
love it ! we ve used it to grind from french press to cappuccino ,  without a hitch . 
it is principally the same machine reguardless of who s name is on it . 
i use it mainly for preparing coffee beans for storage . 
you should quickly learn to get used to not putting the heat so high with these pans . 
i have used this while sitting in a deer stand charging num_num iphones . 
this shaker is all glass and stainless steel . 
it replaces parchment paper and it is washable and reusable . 
when i came to get one for the florida place ,  this was the one i needed . 
it pulls a beautiful shot ,  and i love having so much control over each shot . 
don t let the rest of the pot sit on the burner and then throw it away . 
within a year the plastic tube on the shredding disk began to break . 
my old krups made great ,  hot coffee; i was hoping the cuisinart would also . 
yes it s a pain ,  but this is what s necessary when you must always be connected . 
if you wear glasses like me you want high end quality sound and mic then this is your headset . 
it reminds me of my grandma and my childhood days on the farm . 
the amazon description says this charger is rated for num_extend but the label on the charger says num_extend
i had ozarka deliver water to my family and it was getting to expensive . 
i m not very good at these things so i m sure others who are handy had a much easier time . 
access to the volume and power buttons is not at all obstructed . 
also ,  they re not quite as large or easy to load as my canvas bag . 
after all ,  it is the kettle that could perform on all the necessary levels . 
it works amazingly and stands up to a lot of abuse . 
two minutes in my microwave and i have a big bowl of popcorn . 
i bought this item to listen to much while i ran . 
i did use the bare floor attachment and actually prefer to clean the bare floors not using it . 
it cooks everything evenly and it gets that perfectly done color . 
noisy ,  but not as bad as some . overall :  well built and a great product for the money . 
that stand is locked in there quite well . 
but the cut of the blade was impressive !  a good buy especially for as much as we use it . 
so there s a guessing game in that regard as well .   . 
they really don t get a lot of use because they re just a little too small . 
for normal phone tasks ,  the boxwave works great . 
i have been frustrated with the treo num_extend because of its low quality external speaker . 
i just wish acrylic had a few more products along this line . 
isn t that the ultimate goal ?  ?  ?  this is the bluetooth headset that you need to buy !  . 
love all the color cases for such a cheap price . 
they work great drowning out all the noise while i am working out !  would buy them again . 
i can pop it off and clean it easily . 
over time i ve become a fan of oxo products . 
i put any delicate items that need to be washed . 
once that s been taken care of though ,  this thing really cooks . 
the result ,  i m not wasting gallons of water . 
now my phone will last for a while when i am traveling . 
if you are a good cook ,  i d be willing to bet you ll love this pan ,  too . 
in addition to the clip ,  there is an additional loop that can be snapped around your belt . 
two pulses in one direction and one or two in the other direction gets most of the jobs done . 
i love the big round cookies it makes also ,  they come out in perfect uniform size every time . 
this product is awesome !  the previous reviews about the sturdiness of this product ,  i found was very wrong . 
this device does both of those actions quickly . 
you really can t go wrong for this price . 
had no problem with air bubbles when applying ,  removed the few dust particles with tape . 
on my ipad num_extend series ,  it has actually charged my ipad faster than plugging it into the wall . 
i purchased the lenox  holiday nouveau  num_extend round tablecloth to coordinate with several lenox holiday nouveau serving pieces . 
i have three teenage boys who eat a lot and we tend to cook large meals . 
this is great to have on hand and a fun thing to do with kids or grandchildren . 
this is exactly the same as the one it replaced and works perfectly . 
much more workable for me in our apartment than an outdoor barbeque . 
my iphone num_extend connected instantly the first time i turned this on . 
although this case is called  rubberized ,   it more of a hard plastic case with a soft surface feel . 
it does not rotate in every direction like the comparably priced starbucks machine . 
thanks amazon and the manufacturer for good packing and quick shipping . 
charges quickly  but since it s going to be there while you re asleep ,  speed shouldn t matter too much  . 
on it s high heat setting ,  it uses only num_num watts . 
as long as you have a microwave ,  you ll need one of these . 
this butter dish easily stores a standard sized quarter pound stick of butter with room to spare . 
this cord has been put through the wringer with my iphone num_num and it still works num_extend years later . 
i believe the free rpm is about num_num and num_num amps on the xt . 
at the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting . 
the resultant edges are smooth enough not to easily cut you . 
 backlight would make it perfect  .  .  .  .  . sound quality is pretty good ,  though not great . 
calphalon has become my favorite brand of cookware . 
the lg optimus v  part of the one series  is an excellent starter phone for android . 
overall ,  i got exactely what i expected which is perfect . 
i searched long and hard to find a quality charger for my phone . 
the space bag does take some effort to use since you have to roll the air out . 
ok ,  this is like the third time i have rated this . 
it s effective  clear  range is appx num_num feet . 
it does an excellent job for a hand sharpener ,  and it is very convenient to carry . 
as time goes on ,  i see num_num circles of dust showing up on the tulle . 
these were significantly cheaper than the cast aluminum pan . 
who ever designed this did a bang up job a good looking sleek design and looks futheristic . 
i like being able to attach it to my belt or just hang it on my pants pocket . 
i love my knives and this is fast becoming a favorite . 
this pan is the perfect size for my household . 
it is protective too !  when mine wears out if it does  i will buy another !  . 
this makes that particular part difficult to clean . 
the grease channel has to be dumped ,  kind of messey with a hot griddle . 
my experience with steak has not been good and i need to experiment more . 
no damages to it and no fading color after my extensive use and changes . 
the first is a two piece hard shell that snaps around the ipod . 
the can opener ,  also cuts down on effort . 
you can use itunes or windows media to sort of organize your stuff on the phone itself . 
this would be good for a single person ,  college student ,  or small family . 
otherwise this works amazingly well in a variety of different sized pots . 
they are good looking ,  not cheap or flimsy ,  and the mill works perfectly . 
plastic very sturdy and holds up well to the microwave heat . 
we have the older model of these delonghi radiator heaters from a relative . 
it hugs the phone tight enough that many people won t know you have a case on it . 
i also found that it had a pretty long battery life . 
i store this item in the freezer with the attachments so its ready to go when i am . 
i am using a rooted and modded inspire num_extend
the sound quality is awesome for me and callers ,  some say too good . 
he tells me it is by far the best one he has ever used . 
we totally love its versibility to mount is various areas . 
i suggest you give it as a gift . 
i bought this springform pan based on the recommendation of several trusted sources ,  including cook s illustrated magazine . 
this kitchenaid unit was purchased to make ice cream . 
it s easy to keep the set shiny if you use the steel wool soap pads once a while . 
it is so thin and light you barely realize it s on the phone . 
probably should not have purchased as fried foods are not good for you but they taste good . 
haha .  . trust me i learned from experience . i was a blackberry user for years ,  and i never wanted to switch . 
i use them for my fish tanks with my salts ,  buffers and chemicals . 
in that time ,  i ve managed to drop my phone several times . 
i love this blue tooth !  i ve had several over the years and i finally decided o try again . 
the cable the samsung facinate comes with allways came loose . 
the size is nice ,  comes with cables and adapters or just use your current usb cable . 
i use to make my tea in big quantities since i drank so much . 
handles are actually a bit longer than the blade but that is the novelty . 
those types of microphones are great for popstars ,  but i prefer a headset that is a little less noticeable . 
i needed something unbreakable for my daughter s bathroom ,  but also wanted something reasonably attractive and this fit the bill . 
it is secure enough that i could probably go jogging with it and not fall out . 
i have another set from different brand but these are my favorites . 
we cook hamburgers ,  steaks ,  hot sandwiches ,  the possibilites are nearly endless . 
i do agree with the other statements about the container being a bit on the cheap side . 
they are great for placing baking goods on when they come out of the oven . 
depending on what you use them for ,  they should last for many years . 
i foresee the vacuum being released like the other reviewers mentioned . 
a little more work to clean up after . 
i have a  yuck  glass top stove and need to make bone broth on a regular basis . 
i attempted the electrical tape fix i ve seen on youtube ,  but it did not work . 
also ,  a little indicator will come on saying  time s up  ,  and the counter start to count up . 
i have owned my machne for over a decade and haven t had the slightest problem with it . 
i d had non stick fry pans up until now ,  they worked fine ,  nothing wrong with them . 
i m hoping it does not develop a rust issue ,  who knows . 
this is probably the best bb for the money . 
much better price than williams sonoma and other high end cooking shops . 
due to this efficiency ,  it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat . 
i took my standard bundt cake recipe and cut it in half ,  and it was perfect for this pan . 
this juicer is a monster ,  it will juice anything you through down the tube . 
i have two small children ,  perhaps enough said but . 
keep charged batteries for spares when your battery goes dead . 
i really enjoy these with my wok cooking . 
this is a plastic shamppoer and the pieces dont install well . 
use small amounts and use the shake method after salting . 
i hang the from a hook in the kitchen . 
as mentioned ,  the mesh is fine enough that only the tiniest tea leaf particles get through . 
it keeps you connected in your vehicle and with it you really are on the go !  . 
it is a very sturdy batter bowl and it will last years to come . 
because of my mistake ,  the dough rose too much and eventually collapsed on itself . 
if you use just a coffee cup or mug ,  be sure not to overfill the reservoir . 
i am going to try and interrupt the cycle to make pizza dough . 
another plus is that it is reasonably light for its size . 
the icarrier is another well built battery by them . 
very nice sauce pan i used yesterday all the long and it was easy to clean . 
it took me a few applications before i got good at it . 
for the price ,  i doubt you can find a better carving knife . 
when juicing ,  the motor is loud ,  but seems a lot quieter than other juicers i ve heard . 
i put this in a upstairs room to circulate the air up there . 
rezound  ,  the thunderbolt s screen is noticeably wider and negligibly shorter . 
riveted handles are exceptionally strong ,  but make the pot a bit harder to clean . 
it has increased my water intake easily a hundred fold . 
but i have other spatulas for when i need a straight edge . 
i always clean it after using and add a layer of cooking oil to keep it nice . 
no worries there !  my phone and ipod were taken care of thanks to this battery . 
this headset was purchased to replace a jabra num_extend
so ,  he started using on grill at home and had to purchase another for glamping . 
con :  nonepro :  it contains a sturdy yet beautiful cutting board . 
it is beautiful with a smooth ,  shiny finish . 
well worth the money ,  and perhaps nail polish could replace the markings that wear off ?  . 
i had ordered two swatters because a friend had complained about his old swatter . 
coffee had to change the design of the tea maker and the new pitchers are squatter . 
i bought one of these mixers several months ago and have used it extensively . 
we have been using it for almost num_num years ,  with sharpening in between . 
the phone began to freeze on phone calls and camera gallery . 
the num_extend uses a regular sim so swapping this sim isn t possible without this adapter . 
it is very nice comes with a car charger and an aux . 
i ve only done one cake in it so far ,  but had no problems with it sticking or cooking unevenly . 
i love this !  i was a little upset that when i received it ,  it was broken . 
the same goes for beef and pork roasts . 
if you like guacomole or margaritas .  .  . this is for you . 
i use it when i clean the outside refrig . 
i expect to use these dishes for the rest of my life . 
this is my third attempt at a thermal carafe . 
i m amazed that i never get any unpopped kernels ,  as i did with microwave bags . 
i use this vent mount with my samsung galaxy nexus and my ipod . 
i had to season the press ,  but that was easy . 
the plantronics  . audio num_num usb stereo headset is good quality for a compact headset . 
with the glass lid i can see if the liquid is all absorbed with out letting the steam out . 
i can still connect power cord at bottom and speaker cable at top fine . 
we also used it in our barbecue and surprise it worked great ,  so so easy to clean . 
if you are in need of one ,  this would be a good choice . 
it can also be pressed into service as a last line of defense . 
i bought this toaster about a month ago and i am very pleased with it . 
like i said ,  it is not really steam . 
more important ,  she speaks clearly and eloquently ,  pronouncing names with a natural voice . 
then i made a cup where i tightly tamped my espresso ground coffee into the filter container . 
this will clean out the intake tube and prevent the dribbling as the num_num star poster mentioned . 
it is very sharp ad makes peeling very easy . 
it gives a little extra room to work ,  and fits nicely on my oven rack . 
keep the phone clean and had no problem with it . 
my num_extend fits perfectly with the protective skin on it . 
i bought it because it is the meat pounder alton brown recommended . 
the domed lid is perfect to keep things from splattering . 
i use these in my overhead flexible four inch system for dust control . 
i am very happy with my purchase and highly suggest it to anyone who needs a mixer . 
i have purchased other soup mugs ,  but this is the one for me . 
this machine works well for me and is a breeze to clean . 
i just wipe them off with a damp cloth to clean . 
some people bash the back battery cover which is a thin plastic cover . 
i recommend it to all of my friends that have carpet . 
volume buttons are a little hard to get to but not to bad . 
this slicer is so sharp and very easy to use for my tendinitis wrist . 
wow ,  for the price it s a really good cable . 
these are great screen protecters and look very nice . 
typical that something so good and so long lasting ,  is not available any longer . 
these kitchen shears rock and are in heavy rotation in my kitchen . 
we re impressed with this line and are likely to buy more . 
these classic knifes are exactly what i expected . 
bench press ,  sit ups ,  etc .   these sets would be perfect . 
i don t have that fear with the vent mounting . 
update :  obviously i caved in and got the num_extend anyway . 
a good cell phone ,  but absolutely no peripheral features .  . the good :  very clear voice qualities ,  acceptable speaker phone function . 
i have purchased glass lids for many of my pots ,  etc . 
i discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged . 
the glass protectors are catching on ,  check one out . 
and they were all cheeply made and they could not afford a real good made one . 
they are fabulous and indespensable if you are a cook . 
i bought this item for me ,  my grandson and yes even my cats . 
this is really a great buy for about $
after buying what seemed like every ice cream scoop on the market ,  we finally found perfection . 
they get a lot of wear ,  so i buy them two at a time . 
once you use this one you will never go back to pounding your meat with anything else . 
i had solid ones before with no rollers . 
i like to make water with fruit in it . 
whoever posted that it was too light was just trying to pull our chain . 
the discount cards for places like cvs ,  walgreens ,  etc  . 
would highly recommend for anyone wanting to grill inside . 
recommended for anyone who wants to save money . 
the handle is shorter than my regular pans ,  and the handle can get very hot during cooking . 
bought for use in making cocoa ,  french onion soup and to microwave without the handles getting hot . 
it saves trips back and forth to the kitchen if we re spending time outside . 
it keeps the square shape of the iphone without being too bulky . 
not protective only stylish but it wasnt intenedeintended to protect my case for me only for cute . 
the rolled top edge makes it easy on the hands when cutting mulitple cookies etc . 
but ,  hey what do you expect for a num_num mah beast . 
if not for this ,  i d have given it five stars . 
it s non nonstick ,  but it s not very sticky and it cleans up very easily by hand . 
so the best option is to buy the cheap cases that she can do that with . 
the long handle makes it top heavy when trying to rest it somewhere . 
there are far more positive reviews than negative reviews !  . 
thanks so very much for an awesome case . 
other than that ,  this vacuum is great for apartment dwellers and people who live in small living places . 
it dust doesn t have the width to turn those bigger items well . 
i cut up a ziploc bag and used it for the bottom and top and pressed another tortilla out . 
i am very picky about my morning coffee and am willing to pay to have a quality machine . 
this pressure cooker is a welcome addition to my kitchen . 
there are also belt loops but i have not used them yet . 
if you make big batches ,  get a big cuisinart . 
i can t wait to get home and try the bagel dough recipe . 
makes a good cup of coffee and does it reasonably quickly . 
it fits perfectly and i like how it is hugs my phone . 
i like the design too ,  so i have enjoyed drinking out of them . 
great buy !  i love to decorate my bb . 
this one will be coming out much more frequently . 
the smaller plates are great for toast in the mornings . 
we were so happy that amazon carried this . 
when i told them the bargain ,  they asked me to order for them . 
hope this helps someone get a better idea of the product . 
i bought this as my wife has developed a taste for guacamole dip . 
i don t cut raw meat on the boards ,  and ocassionally ,  i wash my boards in a little bleach water . 
it hasn t really proved problematic ,  as the touch response doesn t seem to be affected ,  but it s a little awkward . 
if you put it back on your warm stove ,  it helps dry it more quickly . 
thinking of ordering some as gifts for my friends who also have iphones . 
not really enough to leave a huge residue but a puff . 
it s a great product for a great price !  !  !  cant beat it !  !  !  . 
easy install ,  hold great on bumpy roads and i havent had any noises or vibrations . 
glass is thick and durable and fits nicely in the wire frame . 
it was the correct item and was delivered within num_num days of order being placed . 
very good price also as the same item at verizon costs almost num_extend
it s a phone charger for the motorola razor ,  and guess what ?  it works for it . 
i hear it works well ,  but i don t have the experience myself ,  therefore i can t give first hand experience . 
i unscrewed the fuse cap to reveal a tiny glass type fuse . 
they wash up easily ,  and the plastic container is perfect for storage . 
this one is so much better than the cheap types i ve subjected myself to in the past . 
a plastic blade guard would be a nice addition . 
couldnt be that much harder to add it . 
cheaper then what s in the store ,  and seems to be working fine . 
bought these to fight the glare from lights and being outside . 
i am very hard on my dishes and have been using corelle for years because of it . 
took me two tries but they work nicely . 
plus i ve found it to be very accurate . 
just this one product and cakes and breads pop out of their pan perfectly . 
my fiancee picked it out and she loves it . 
use plastic wrap or simple napkin over them and no problems . 
bought as a gift after having the griffin num_extend amps car charger . 
it s pretty thin so just take care of it . 
but back to the stand mixer ,  it is worth every penny for this kitchenaid . 
now that i have them all back ,  i m good to go !  . 
i will keep an eye out for more to add to my collection . 
i keep one in the car and others in the charging drawer at the house . 
this is as good as you can get for a dollar less screen protector . 
they clean up in the dishwasher easily too . 
i bought a different brand . i have owned this model for several years . 
thanks to amazon ,  i can find a replacement at any time of the year . 
very happy with this new addition to my kitchen . 
it doesn t plug directly into the iphone so you will need to also carry a charging cord . 
it worked great in my car and charged my phone quickly . 
these were ok ,  didn t like real small ones . 
it s easy to install due to the slight stretch in the plastic . 
how i don t know . first i sent an email to sf planet via amazon . com . 
have used filter pitchers and this is much easier to use . 
my next test is going to be a small pork or beef roast with baby potatoes ,  carrots and onions . 
the straight sides allow for a cake that will be even and beautiful . 
the background noise cancellation on this thing is the top of the line . 
the problem is that my family seems to go through screen protectors like candy . 
he does not run or profusely sweat in these ,  so i cannot attest to the moisture durability . 
the three wand attachments are great for their specified purposes . 
fits neatly over your appliance with smoothly contoured lines . 
my phone runs hot while charging ,  however it does charge . 
other cloths i have purchased in the past were of such low quality that they were ,  in essence ,  disposable . 
it makes a perfect cheesecake and now i m planning on ordering another one . 
all you have to to is clear the cache . 
unfortunately ,  i only have regular applecare ,  not applecare plus  plus only started recently  . 
any case with even a hint of silicone ,  makes it a difficult task to extract from my pocket . 
i am tall so i do not have the problem some other reviewers have had of seeing the gauge . 
i love cooking in my iron skillet ,  it gives a much better flavor to food . 
the day it came in i made french fries and they came out crisp and great . 
i like that the cord can be concealed in the base . 
but since i got this one ,  it s the only one i use . 
i have used two out of the three knives ,  first remember the set is under $ for the set . 
however you want to get that ,  its up to you . 
it is very sturdy and i love the idea of no gaskets to deal with . 
the footprint is almost as big as the processor ,  but it easily fits in the cabinet . 
the guard stays put for a long time . 
i was actually pretty impressed with the sound quality of these headphones . 
just wanted to say i was pleasantly surprised when i received this today . 
we looked at several of these devices to gut a pineapple . 
after years of constant use it shows no sign of dulling . 
it is so convenient we ll live with that issue . 
she says it protects her phone from being damaged if she drops it . 
i changed my kitchen to white canister ,  coffee pot ,  etc . 
a sony ericcson may be the phone for you . 
juicer looks great ,  and is very well made . 
as mentioned earlier the item arrived as stated and the price was very excellent . 
i live in an apartment and did not want the fire alarm going off . 
when i first ordered i was nervous bc this product was supposed to be compatible with iphone . 
the price of the item well surpasses any hangups one might have . 
the contents will then cool very quickly . try this bowl to cool down custard when you are filling pastries . 
this is one of those items that delivers everything it promises . 
thought enough of them that we bought another set for a gift and the friend likes them too . 
they are heavy duty and i put hot items on them with no problems . 
love this pan for cooking for a crowd or making sheet cakes . 
this steamer has two compartments which will hold enough veggies for a family of num_extend
even the flash works well and doubles nicely as a flashlight . + battery life . 
either they do not fit properly ,  or they do not last . 
this one is being used at least weekly . 
even my son who is a boy scout loves it to sharpen his scout knife . 
however ,  it is a bit difficult to clean . 
you just have to make sure you pack down the grounds lightly before brewing . 
i was a bit skeptical of the practicality of this . 
love this dinnerware ,  have had a complete set for about num_num years and they are still in great condition . 
it fits perfect over the buttons and no gaps around the edge so far . 
it fits snuggly around both the num_num and the num_extend and slides in and out of my pocket . 
make the bread crumbs for my chicken supremes or chicken kiev ?  check ,  check ,  and check . 
i m dieting so i use an airpopper a lot . 
i could drive and get coffee faster than that . 
the machine was perfect  ,  it works like a dream . 
you need to balance size ,  cost and power . 
for this and for the unmatched service i recieved  without even contacting them  ,  i would highly recommend this product . 
however ,  i m told there is significant noise at highway speed . 
the charger worked fine for a month ,  then just stopped working . 
your phone is protected without a lot of additional bulk . 
bought one for myself ,  then had to buy a second one because my girlfriend stole my first . 
this is a fine mug for teachers ,  business people etc . 
i ve used these numerous times ,  and have issues only because i m kinda tough on a phone . 
i got one of these batteries from oem planet via the amazon . com marketplace . 
the caveat is that it only works if you insert the device as shown in the photos . 
the tea is still burn your mouth hot . 
i look at my kitchen stuff almost like a pet lol . 
i like to make very large batches of soup . 
they have been dropped ,  dented and scratched and still they continue to be my favorite bowls . 
the knife blades slide in and protects the blade . 
i moved into the suburbs where the water is so much better . 
practice with it a bit though ,  it can splash out if you have an odd shaped bottle . 
works well ,  keeps things moving smoothly ,  and helps to keep clean up faster . 
i m not sure if that s my area or the phone itself . 
it is fairly fragile and can break easily ,  so use caution when handling it . 
i use it as a decoration in my kitchen because the wood is so pretty . 
it can be a bit of pain using potholders to pick them up with the eggs inside . 
i want a kitchen stocked with beautifully feeling and looking ,  plus perfectly functionally designed kitchen tools . 
it moves air quite fast for its size . 
this is an awesome product ,  if only in appearance . 
excited because the post office ,  not amazon ,  lost  or stole  my package . 
the only downfall is the distant between iphone and headset is way less than advertised . 
can t wait for mine to arrive so i could enjoy using it too . 
the price was reasonable ,  included shipping and the back arrived four days after i ordered it including a weekend . 
there is no use using the call function in anything but the quietest settings . 
we ve had this pan for a few years now . 
still ,  knowing what i know now i would purchase it again . 
this little brewer is much better for brewing my own coffee and easier to clean . 
however i wish the sides were a bit higher on the outside . 
it holds up to twelve and a half ounces ,  five ounces more than the regular hand soap dispensers . 
it is curved and it helps shape the loaf . 
i originally got this product because i wanted a stylus for my ipad to mark up documents . 
this is not just for paella and mussels . 
if you use your fido jars a lot ,  you will eventually need a pack of these . 
this product is only glass digitizer ,  not the plastic holder underneath of it . 
i would recommend this paddle to any of my friends . 
so i am experimenting with taking filling out . 
i especially love the built in strainers in the lid . 
you can never have too many usb chargers . 
the quality for the price of this pan is awesome . 
the fact that it is not non stick allows for better cooking ,  deglazing ,  carmelizing ,  searing ,  etc . 
bought a second popper recently so we could produce more perfect popcorn at once . 
if you re going to by a manual citrus juice press ,  buy this one . 
though this product lacks class it does fit its function and purpose which is for ice tea . 
i read a lot of reviews on this before i forked out the cash . 
washes reall nice in the dishwasher with no discoler attion . 
elegant enough to impress guests ,  but sturdy and functional for everyday use . 
very small footprint on the counter as well . 
however ,  the baker in the family will want a nice clean silpat for her christmas cookies . 
really nice ,  sturdy measuring cups with good grips . 
gotta love black goes with everything ,  and of course it s the only color men want to have . 
they promptly responded that it was ,  and when the battery arrived ,  it was indeed a real motorola . 
have been needing one for awhile and decided to buy this one . 
this is a very nice case  ,  it fits just right and it closes and opens nicely . 
unlocked phones  carrier unlocked  do not require  activation  and will take any gsm sim  standard size  . 
the best thing about this is that food doesn t stain the inside . 
for the average kitchen i suspect this would last a lifetime . 
this was a great replacement for our bodum french press . 
my old charger s cable was flimsy and it stopped working right when bent in a certain position . 
saves your hands from getting cut and lids dropping in your food . 
i can put salad veggies in here together and they all come out uniformly . 
anyway ,  if you need the right angle ,  then it will be a num_num star review for you . 
this extended battery was excellent ,  price and product .  .  . can t be beat . 
so in the future we will share one . 
they make the water taste much better and help rid the water of nasty things . 
what were they thinking ?  so glad i could still find the digital display foreman . 
as usual ,  take care not to slip ,  because the points are fine ,  and will easily shred flesh . 
it is sleek looking and it cleans up very well . 
using it to charge my galaxy num_extend right now . 
i was using a griffin unit that has buttons instead of motion sensing to control the iphone . 
i have a french press that i ve been using at work ,  and the coffee is delicious and consistent . 
having had cheaper large pots ,  i steered away from buying this expensive pot . 
it fell and scooped right underneath the egg . 
were it not for my glasses ,  it would be perfect . 
i purchased these form amazon in num_num and we are still using them on a daily basis . 
only thing when it gets dropped it gets a bit scratched up on the corners . 
one gratin recipe called for num_num grated potatoes . 
little by little ,  i am learning to make our food from scratch . 
these are hard to find in local stores . 
i must say that i love every one of them . 
i can t say enough good things about this great lid . 
this reduces the suction which is critical in removing as much water from the carpet as possible . 
as a household with just two people ,  i find that the medium sized loaf is perfect for us . 
i wish it would just beep until i shut it off . 
they also appear to be better made and more durable . 
i absolutely love this thing !  !  !  !  !  !  i used to have the mr . 
they are tools . we will keep mario s ,  and move biff s measuring tools to the camping supplies . 
all the rest is good . the phone is terrific as a phone . 
this extends the use and life of the board and i think it s a shame to take that away . 
my very first cup was heaven ,  i ve never experienced such a robust ,  wonderful coffee . 
but once in a while ,  a large skillet is called for ,  and this one is perfect . 
it does have the cool v handle and i look forward to many years of use . 
so i don t worry about warping or discoloration of the handle . 
and i love it !  ! is easy to use and handles big batches of anything i want to make . 
this mitt is thick enough to protect your hands but not so thick that you can t feel the handle . 
if you prefer russets ,  cut them in half or even quarters . 
i made my favorite apricot brandy pound cake in it and it has never looked or tasted so good . 
found a good price on amazon and it included free shipping ,  couldn t go wrong . 
we use this every morning making our espresso . 
is it the closest i found for fit ,  volume ,  clarity out and in etc ?  absolutely . 
you can use it to rest ,  flatbreads on it ,  too . 
this charger works well considering it is not an actually apple product . 
the color is more vibrant that the picture and makes it easy to find in my purse . 
the screen protector is a nice feature as well . no complaints !  . 
keeps food warm and i am using it regularly . 
all of my other tongs don t hold the food as well . 
does exactly what you would expect it to do . 
i gave it num_num stars because i had to return the first on . 
this pair from calphalon has good tension ,  not too tight or loose ,  and are comfortable in your hand . 
i m very excited about using this attachment with my old kitchenaid mixer that i bought back in num_extend
but as the unit bumped and moved along ,  i was quite amazed at the cleaning power of the roomba . 
lids fit perfect after several washings in the dishwasher top shelf  . 
i took a key to it and it still looks great . 
music and speech are rendered really ,  really well . 
you will ask yourself how did i ever live without this great mixer . 
i ve has the num_extend model for num_num months and it is great . 
unlike some people who use this water for only cooking purposes  , i drink this water and love it . 
the surface is  rubberized  so it won t slip in your hands . 
easy desgin ,  just slip your finger in and it slices through the peel . 
however ,  if you re in the middle of cooking something ,  this can be a quandary . 
for him ,  he gets a dessert ,  a veg ,  a salad and a main . 
riedel is one of the tests that is easy for even beginning drinkers to see the difference in . 
when you let it cool on it s own ,  that is part of the actual cooking time with the pressurization . 
keeps our counters looking more neat and organized . 
hard to tell ,  however ,  when measuring water or other clear liquids . 
i use it everyday and its been great . 
this headset is exactly as described by the manufacturer . 
my husband has num_num cup of french press in the mornings . 
the juice tastes delicious and the consistency is smooth with a perfect amount of juicy foam at the top . 
great for slicing where surface tension is high and inner stability threatened . 
as far as the filters on all the brands ,  they are basically charcoal based . 
having the right tools makes any task easier . 
we ve had it almost num_num months and it still works like the day we got it . 
perfect ,  well build and also perfectly fit all kinds of gismoz . 
the case sacrificed itself  the top corner cracked  but i d rather replace a num_extend case over a num_extend iphone . 
this juicer does a good job making this drink which i really can t make in the vitamix . 
i cconsidered replacing it with the bosch universal plus but instead went with this kitchenaid pro num_extend
great cookware . you can keep a pot of chili or pasta sauce simmering without scorching for hours . 
ok ,  i m with everybody when it comes to this tray . 
it heats fast and is very efficient in heating . 
to be fair ,  i ve only tried a couple of bluetooth headsets ,  but this is definitely not a disappointment . 
they work great and especially for frying chicken to searing steaks . 
thank goodness for amazon !  i found the exact match . 
we got this after our old beater began to flake off . 
the stones were easy to heat in the microwave ,  and they held heat through dinner . 
besides that it has been a great case . 
a finer grind coffee will give you major flavor without having to use so much i found . 
considering the above ,  it s well worth this price . 
she loves the shade of yellow and says it is a perfect addition to her other fiesta sets . 
bought these because of plans to take cakes to fund raisers . 
this cover fits it nicely and together they do make a statement of color . 
all you have to do is pulse the food chopper until the desired size is attained . 
not too big or too small but just right . 
normally i m partial to the oxo stuff ,  but this juice press is miles better . 
it s cleared up a lot of space in my pantry and made getting to my spices much handier . 
i use them for fruit ,  mixing ,  even togo food that needs a bowl like pho ,  curry ,  etc . 
only issue is when you first put them on you have to have patience and a steady hand . 
every thing comes with it that is needed to hang it on the wall . 
i think they ll last as long as i want them around . 
and the retractable cord is also a very nice feature . 
never have found anything as good at this as these bamboo brushes .  .  .  !  . 
the unit size is nice and there is room to fry a lot of potatoes . 
we are back to buy another cordless vacuum . 
but you can use paper filters in this machine if you want to . 
it looks as good as it did when i first got it . 
great for slow cooking baby food and for dips at a great price . 
love this knife ,  a definite go to staple piece in my kitchen . 
the handle feels a little plasticky ,  and less grippy or weighted than expected . 
it s the perfect size ,  does what it needs to ,  was a good price for what i wanted . 
i wish i would have had this when i was single . 
they seem to be pretty accurate and durable as well . 
i cant believe how much hair and dust it picked up . 
bought this for my mother when her old bunn coffee maker wouldn t quit leaking . 
but i can t say that i really like popcorn without that butter . 
i thought it would dull easily or wear down ,  after all it s only $ but i was wrong . 
air vents like the ones in some of the other review pics are the ones it works with . 
it definitely takes more effort to press the button ,  but it is by no means impossible or even difficult . 
it s great because of it s heavy duty material . 
it looks good doing it too ,  though that s frankly not a consideration . 
everyone heard me clearly and i heard them clearly . 
the inside lid of the door pops off for quick cleaning , revealing the inner surface of the door with gaskets . 
the batter was so thick i had to spoon it under the support bars . 
the cradle is snapped onto the mount and is ready for use . 
work well as a serving bowl or as a soup bowl . 
i did not bother reading the directions ,  and was able to set it up easily . 
however ,  it over heats if i use it to long without a break . 
the padding is a nice touch and there is no sag in it when its hanging from the vent . 
this is a terrific item if your washer is not right near your dryer . 
the parts were perfect and fit together easily . 
i just received the num_extend screen protector and i would definitely say that it is made of good quality . 
they clean easy ,  lightweight and take no space to store upright . 
it says to replace in num_num months ,  but actually you should base this time on the rate of use . 
i used num_num grams of flour to num_num eggs for my pasta dough . 
but i wasn t that impressed with it after my first use .
